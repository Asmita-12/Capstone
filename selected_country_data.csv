AGO,1984,"﻿A few days ago, we had the legitimate satisfaction of learning that the international community had elected to the presidency of the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly a remarkable African diplomat and worthy representative of Zambia. Mr. President, while this choice testifies to the recognition of your merits and is a just reward for the untiring efforts you have made, in particular in defence of the right of peoples to liberty and independence, it also constitutes a tribute to your country, which is known for its commitment to noble ideals and causes and with which the People's Republic of Angola has excellent relations of friendship, solidarity and co-operation. Hence, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola, we are very pleased to join in the warm congratulations addressed to you, Sir, and to wish you the greatest success in carrying out such lofty responsibilities.
2.	Allow us to take this opportunity to express to your predecessor, Mr. Jorge Illueca, our deep appreciation and admiration for the worthy and far-sighted way in which he carried out his mandate and our best wishes for success in his presidential functions and for the prosperity of the Panamanian people.
3.	We should also like to repeat to the Secretary- General our deepest gratitude for his clarity and exemplary seriousness in the defence of the fundamental principles of the United Nations, as well as the laudable action he has undertaken for lessening tensions and settling numerous conflicts, in spite of the glaring lack of resources made available to him.
4.	The United Nations family has just admitted a new Member, Brunei Darussalam. The Angolan Government joins ail those who have welcomed that country and wished it a prosperous future.
5.	In the hope that sooner or later a growing number of States Members of the United Nations, and not just some, will equally and duly be taken seriously when they address the General Assembly, we are obliged to repeat what we have already said, to the extent that no significant or positive change has taken place which would counteract the progressive deterioration in the international situation during these last four years.
6.	At each session of the General Assembly, all of us come to reaffirm our adherence to the noble purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to repeat our commitment to the cause of freedom, peace, justice, democracy, solidarity, development and co-operation.
7.	At the beginning of each statement, almost invariably it is emphasized that the session of the General Assembly is taking place at a very critical moment, even as the international situation has worsened to the point where it seriously threatens the survival of mankind.
8.	But between the fine words or the best of intentions and respecting them or carrying them out, it cannot be denied that there is a gap which becomes wider at each session. And all we do each year is repeat ourselves, thus testing the spirit of tolerance or resistance of those who have to do the listening and the credibility of those who are addressing the Assembly.
9.	Several times from this very rostrum we have expressed the deep concern of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola over the impotence, the resignation or the abdication of the competent inter-national bodies with regard to facing up to the proliferation of hotbeds of tension, fomented directly or indirectly by the imperialist Powers.
10.	No one here should be unaware of the causes and agents responsible for such a dark international picture. We repeat the question: how long will the peoples and Governments that cherish peace and justice have to wait for the adequate bodies existing within the United Nations truly to meet their responsibilities and firmly take the most effective measures—which, by the way, are available to them— with regard to those who violate the fundamental principles of the Charter; carry out colonial wars and foment aggression of every kind, directly or indirectly, against States which take independent and progressive positions; practise economic plundering in the underdeveloped countries and persist in preventing the gradual bridging of the gap between the wealthy or developed countries and the poor or underdeveloped countries; deliberately hinder the serious efforts made by the socialist countries and the progressive and democratic forces to achieve detente, general and complete disarmament, a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons; encourage the arms race, thus assuring fantastic profits for their military consortia and leading to growing increases in military budgets and expenditures; multiply the carrying out of huge military manoeuvres intended to intimidate or even to commit aggression against certain peoples or States; do not respect the relevant resolutions or decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] undermine the authority and the efforts of the Secretary-General in carrying out his lofty responsibilities by failing to provide him with the necessary means; threaten international peace and security by military intervention and illegal occupation of territories, by interference in the internal affairs of other States and by not respecting the principle of non-recourse to force and of the settlement of disputes by negotiations?
11.	All these aspects, but especially the unbridled arms race with its spectre of a nuclear war, involve a phenomenal increase in expenditures, which in turn increases inflation, causing huge budgetary deficits and further reducing the already shrinking volume of economic assistance provided to the underdeveloped countries, a factor which in itself has greatly contributed to the present economic crisis, one which can be solved only by taking measures to establish a new international economic order, a measure already advocated several years ago by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.
12.	Given this alarming situation, which clearly endangers the future of peoples, and faced with the growing tragedy that is being experienced by millions of human beings who are still deprived of their freedom and their right to choose their own destiny and who do not possess the ways and means to counteract slavery and humiliation, tyranny and poverty, famine, ignorance and disease, it is imperative that at this session the General Assembly commit itself to the search for effective ways and means to solve the problems which afflict mankind.
13.	In looking at the problems that face the African continent, we feel once again that the current situation in southern Africa must be given very special attention at this session of the General Assembly, since we are confronted by a type of deadlock in the development of the independence process for Namibia. No one is unaware that the Namibian question was broadly discussed last year in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, in the Security Council and in the General Assembly and that, subsequently, diplomatic efforts were undertaken by the interested parties in order to secure, in accordance with the Lusaka understanding of 16 February 1984, the unilateral disengagement of South African troops from Angolan territory and to create adequate conditions for negotiations between the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the Pretoria regime, under the auspices of the United Nations, in order to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).
14.	In spite of the serious commitment by the Angolan side and SWAPO, the South African military disengagement, which was planned to take place within 30 days, has not been completed. A series of pretexts have systematically been presented by the Pretoria regime during the seven months that have already passed. It is becoming clear that there is a lack of seriousness on the part of South Africa, which is deliberately trying to delay or prevent the independence process of Namibia by attempting now to establish a double linkage, that is to say, to subordinate the completion of the withdrawal of its troops to the results of the negotiations under way with SWAPO, on the one hand, and to make the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) conditional upon the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces from the People's Republic of Angola, on the other.
15.	In this regard, we feel that it would be useful to recall a passage from the joint declaration of the Angolan and Cuban Governments made on 19 March 1984:
""In the context of this peace effort on the part of Angola, the joint declaration of 4 February [1982] remains in full force and constitutes a basis of principle for any negotiated situation that will eliminate the current tension and ensure peace and full independence for the nations of this region.
""Having strict regard to what is laid down in the above-mentioned joint declaration, the Governments of Cuba and Angola reiterate that they will reinitiate, by their own decision and in exercise of their sovereignty, the execution of the gradual withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist military contingent as soon as the following requirements are met:
""1. Unilateral withdrawal of the racist troops of South Africa from Angolan territory;
""2. Strict implementation of resolution 435 (1978) of the United Nations Security Council, the accession of Namibia to true independence and the total withdrawal of the South African troops which are illegally occupying that country;
""3. Cessation of any act of direct aggression or threat of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola on the part of South Africa, the United States of America and their allies.""
""4. Cessation of all aid to the counter-revolutionary organization UNITA and any other puppet group from South Africa, the United States of America and their allies . . .
""Satisfaction of these demands would mean respect for the rules of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations and observance of the many resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of African Unity.""
16.	It is therefore clear that the Angolan and Cuban Governments have never questioned the principle, as such, of the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces. It is also clear that the Angolan Government has always taken a flexible attitude as long as doing so does not call into question the guiding principles of its foreign policy and its national interests. Angola has put forward constructive proposals on several occasions. We therefore reject any responsibility for the present deadlock which we find in the independence process for Namibia. Such responsibility lies fully with South Africa and the United States.
17.	It seems useful for us to emphasize once again that Namibia is a trust territory of the United Nations and has been one for more than 30 years. This means that every State Member of the United Nations has direct responsibilities with regard to the independence process of that Territory. Unfortunately, it seems that a large number of States Members of the United Nations have forgotten those responsibilities, for when they leave this heavy burden on the shoulders of the Angolan Government they do not act in accordance with the mandate.
18.	Furthermore, in 1967 the General Assembly adopted a resolution by which it decided to establish or constitute the United Nations Council for Namibia and to define its mandate.
19.	Thus, the following questions arise. Who has prevented the United Nations Council for Namibia from fulfilling its mandate and for what reason? Since 1967, numerous resolutions have been adopted with regard to Namibia's accession to independence and the illegality of its occupation by South Africa. Why did Namibia not accede to independence before November 1975? Was it the fault of the Angolans, who were not even independent, or of the Cubans, who were not even in Angola? How can the responsibility for the delay in the Namibian independence process now be put on the Angolan Government by evoking its alleged intransigence? Has the Security Council nothing to say about the failure to ensure the implementation of its own resolution 435 (1978)?
20.	As has been emphasized by the President of the People's Republic of Angola,
""This process, which is unfolding very slowly, is linked to the recent failure of the negotiations on the cease-fire between SWAPO and the Pretoria regime and this makes it difficult to preserve the present atmosphere of detente on the border between Angola and Namibia. It is therefore essential to increase the pressure of international public opinion on South Africa to respect its commitments, establish a cease-fire agreement with SWAPO and announce the date for the implementation of resolution 435 (1978).""
Nevertheless, as also stated by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos,
""In the southern part of our continent, the People's Republic of Angola continues to be the main target of the global strategy of the imperialist Powers, which are trying to destabilize and paralyse the legitimate nationalist Governments of African countries which are fighting to affirm their identity, independence and national sovereignty.""
21.	On the other hand, everyone is aware of the progressive deterioration of the internal situation in South Africa, as the contradictions within the hateful apartheid regime increase. The valiant fighters of the African National Congress of South Africa [ANC] persist heroically in their political and military actions, the fundamental rights of the overwhelming majority of the South African people continue to be trampled upon and the brutality and arbitrary detentions escalate. All this could be seen just before and after the adoption of the so-called constitutional reforms.
22.	Thus, the time is now propitious for each State Member of the United Nations to fulfil its responsibilities and its commitments—if only in the interest of the credibility of this international body—and consequently for each State Member that is able to do so to give assistance of various kinds to SWAPO and the ANC; to provide, individually or collectively, as a matter of urgency, all possible material and financial assistance to the People's Republic of Angola; to begin, at the international and national levels, an intensive, permanent campaign demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory; and to exert every form of pressure on the Pretoria regime and also on its ""friends and allies"", including comprehensive mandatory sanctions—so often advocated but so far prevented by certain Western Powers from being applied—with the object of bringing to an end the illegal occupation of Namibia and ensuring the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) without any further delay and without any absurd pre-conditions.
23.	We should like now to state or reiterate the position of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola on a number of specific political questions which continue to disturb international relations and threaten world peace and security.
24.	With regard to the situation prevailing in Chad, we feel that it is for the Chadian people to resolve their own problems without any foreign military interference or intervention. We believe that the representatives of that country should be able to decide their own future through negotiations, seated around a table, without constraint or hindrance, in conformity with the efforts and resolutions of the OAU.
25.	We reiterate our conviction that the resolution of the conflict between the Frente POLISARIO1 and the Kingdom of Morocco is to be found in the implementation of resolution AHG/Res. 104 (XIX) on Western Sahara, adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth ordinary session, held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983. It is to be regretted that the Kingdom of Morocco obstinately refuses to embark upon direct negotiations, which indicates insolent disdain for the sovereign decision of the Heads of State and Government of independent Africa. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the heroic people of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and particularly with the valiant fighters of the Frente POLISARIO.
26.	We reaffirm our unshakeable solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and their legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], in their continuing struggle to regain their homeland, usurped by the Zionist entity, and to establish an independent State. Furthermore, we reaffirm our dedication to the Geneva Declaration on Palestine and the Programme of Action for the Achievement of Palestinian Rights, adopted by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine, which was held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983. We demand once again the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem, and we salute the efforts of the Lebanese people to ensure their unity, their sovereignty and their territorial integrity. In this context, we are in favour of a Middle East peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation, on a basis of equality, of all the parties concerned or interested.
27.	With regard to the tragedy which has befallen the people of East Timor because of the occupation by Indonesian armed forces, it is time for the international community seriously and unambiguously to commit itself to a search for a lasting solution to the problem, which has been dragging on for nine years.
28.	Thousands of patriots have been and continue to be imprisoned and tortured. Others have died in armed confrontations or been summarily shot. Yet others die of hunger. The International Committee of the Red Cross is forbidden from entering East Timor in spite of its purely humanitarian mission. As part of the framework of the solution of the conflict through negotiations and in keeping with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV), the leaders of the Democratic Republic of East Timor have proposed a peace plan, including direct or indirect talks between Portugal, Indonesia and FRETILIN, under the auspices of the United Nations, in order to debate the establishment of a multinational United Nations force to ensure the operation of a transitional administration, the implementation of adequate provisions for the stationing of belligerent forces, the organization of free and democratic consultations of the Maubere people and the setting of a date for the transfer of sovereignty.
29.	It is regrettable that the Portuguese Government is not clearly and firmly meeting its historical, political and legal responsibilities for East Timor and that the Indonesian Government is turning a deaf ear to the peace proposals already presented by FRETILIN, which deserve the unreserved support of the international community.
30.	None the less, it is comforting to note the concerns expressed by United States congressmen and senators and also by Pope John Paul II over the genocide of the Maubere people, as well as the positions taken by the workers' parties of Australia and New Zealand.
31.	We urge the Secretary-General to continue his efforts until a definitive solution to this situation is found, and we appeal to the member States of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to identify themselves with and support the struggle of the valiant people of East Timor.
32.	Central America has been undergoing extremely alarming developments as a result of the threats and military intervention of the United States Administration, notably in Nicaragua and El Salvador, What is needed in this region is a search for peace through a negotiated political solution. For this purpose, we support the courageous positions taken by the Government of Nicaragua as well as the efforts of the Contadora Group, reflected in the contents of the revised version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America.
33.	In order for peace to prevail in Central America, there must be peace in El Salvador and an end to the aggression committed against Nicaragua and El Salvador. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberation Nacional and the Frente Democratico Revolucionario, which are the only legitimate representatives of the Salvadorian people.
34.	We renew our unfailing support for the Cuban revolution and denounce the aggressions and threats against the Cuban people. We reiterate our feelings of solidarity with the peoples of Panama, Grenada, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia and Puerto Rico in their just struggles for their national interests, their independence and their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
35.	We reaffirm our support for the efforts to have the dispute over the borderlines between Guyana and Venezuela resolved through bilateral negotiations. On the other hand, and in keeping with General Assembly resolutions, we register our hope that there be, in the immediate future, a start of negotiations between the United Kingdom and Argentina with a view to restoring to Argentina the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
36.	We also reaffirm our support for the efforts of the Indo-Chinese countries to ensure peace and stability in South-East Asia without any foreign intervention, and for a constructive dialogue among the parties to the conflict. None the less, we regret and consider it inconceivable that the Kampuchean people are still not represented in the United Nations by the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. This is an injustice that must be remedied.
37.	We reiterate our solidarity with the just cause of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of their country without any foreign interference and with the call for the withdrawal of the American troops from the southern part of Korean territory. To this end, we support the proposal concerning the holding of tripartite negotiations and the adoption of a peace agreement as a substitute for the Armistice Agreement.
38.	We also reaffirm our support for the position and efforts made by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in the search for the normalization, through negotiations, of the situation in that country.
39.	We reiterate also our full solidarity with the people and Government of Cyprus and support their efforts to maintain their independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-alignment.
40.	Once again we make an urgent appeal to the Governments of Iraq and Iran to put an end to the war and find a negotiated solution to the dispute that separates them.
41.	It is unpleasant to note that the Angolan Government once again finds itself forced to devote the greatest part of its human and material resources to the defence of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The undeclared war that has been opposed upon us by the racist and Fascist South African regime must stop.
42.	It Angolan people dearly wish for peace. They have never committed aggression nor do they wish to commit aggression against anyone. They want only to live in peace and work to build a future of progress and happiness in a just society that they have freely chosen.
43.	The struggle continues! Victory is certain!
"
AGO,1978,"﻿
1.	On analysing the agenda of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly, we foresee intense and delicate activity, in view of the complexity and vast number of the items included. However, we hope that in the course of the debates on such important questions ways and means may be found best suited to the solution of the international problems that we are all obliged to face seriously.
2.	May I first, Mr. President, on behalf of the People's Republic of Angola, extend to you most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty- third session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is testimony of recognition of your noble qualities. At the same time, may we wish you every success in the discharge of your difficult and strenuous mandate.
3.	May we also reaffirm to the outgoing President our highest appreciation of the brilliance and dynamism he imparted to the manifold tasks of this international body during the period when he was invested with similar high responsibilities.
4.	Our feelings of significant appreciation extend to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the dedicated efforts he has consistently made for the solution of the grave problems that affect the international community.
5.	In the course of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, which took place in Belgrade at the end of July this year, we had an opportunity to state that the direct confrontation of many peoples with imperialism, neo-colonialism, colonialism,
Zionism, apartheid expansionism and the exploitation of man by man still constituted an indisputable reality of our era. Under these circumstances, the supreme aspiration of the peoples to peace is far from being guaranteed everywhere in the world, in that we still see continuing colonial wars, acts of aggression of every kind against independent States, inadmissible military interventions, the resurgence of the use of mercenaries, multiple plots against the sovereignty and security of States, foreign domination and occupation and economic plunder. All these factors are fostered entirely by the imperialist or neo-colonialist Powers.
6. This alarming situation prevails, and will continue to prevail for an indeterminate period, so long as the Governments of a certain number of countries, which have already been amply characterized, do not strictly respect the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the policy of non-alignment; so long as many of us are unable to achieve complete independence, taking our national resources into our own hands and using them for the benefit of our peoples and not for that of multinational companies; so long as there is not a categorical rejection of all forms of subordination and dependence, of all interference and of all pressure, whether political, economic or military; so long as it is not forbidden to establish military bases in the most diverse parts of the world, generally imposed or maintained against the will of the peoples concerned, and so long as those already existing are not duly dismantled; so long as all United Nations Members are not seriously and sincerely aiming towards achieving detente, general and complete disarmament and the absolute prohibition of the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, including the neutron bomb; so long as all do not recognize the imperative need to make the Indian Ocean effectively a zone of peace as long as all do not equally recognize and respect the rights of the oppressed peoples to struggle, by armed force or any other means, for national liberation and to choose the political regime that best suits them; so long as the astronomical sums spent on the arms race are not judiciously earmarked for the economic development of under-developed countries; so long as a New International Economic Order has not been created, in accordance with
principles long established and enunciated.
7. In the middle of this year, in this same place, the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, was held. Of the about 150 items on the agenda of this current session of the General Assembly, 14 are related exclusively to general and complete disarmament. This prompts us to make a few brief remarks on this problem of cardinal importance, although the Prime Minister of the 

People's Republic of Angola has already defined our position from this same rostrum.
8. The trend towards achieving real detente appears to us to be predominant now, and this implies taking tangible steps in the field of disarmament. Thus, together with the efforts pursued to achieve agreement on the destruction of stocks of nuclear weapons, it becomes imperative for the nuclear Powers, without exception, to undertake to sign and respect the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and for the guarantees for the security of non-nuclear countries to be strengthened by the adoption of an international convention, in the same way, a treaty on a general and complete end to all nuclear tests should be concluded as soon as possible.
It is our belief, however, that the achievement of these prime goals should be accompanied by the gradual reduction of the military budgets of countries that produce the most diverse types of weapons.
10. Nevertheless, we wish to reaffirm clearly that the principle of not resorting to force for the settlement of international conflicts should not in any way constitute an impediment to the armed struggle of peoples for their national independence or to the exercise of the right to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity against foreign aggression.
11. For these reasons we regard it as absolutely necessary to establish now the requisite conditions or foundations for the holding of the World Conference on Disarmament.
12.	Within this context of general and complete disarmament we cannot fail to mention the untiring and praiseworthy efforts made by the socialist countries, and particularly by the USSR, for the establishment of the most varied treaties and conventions aimed at preserving mankind from the disastrous consequences of the frenzied arms race and greater and lesser wars. If those praiseworthy goals have pot yet been completely achieved, this is solely and exclusively due to the patent lack of seriousness and sincerity on the part of the imperialist Powers, in particular the United States of America, which thus benefit from the fabulous profits made by their armament consortia.
13.	Another question which also merits some reflection is that related to the promotion of and respect for human rights.
14.	We start from the principle that in the constitution of each country Member of the United Nations the rights of its citizens are duly safeguarded. Every Member of this Organization has adhered to or proclaimed its respect for the norms laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Any action honestly intended to make human rights prevail where they are trampled underfoot is, therefore, legitimate.
15.	However, what we cannot understand is that certain Western Powers set themselves up as the great and sole champions of human rights when they themselves clearly
do not respect them. How, for example, can it be conceived that those which most frequently invoke the much acclaimed rights of man should be precisely those which, through their multiform support for the racist and Fascist Pretoria and Salisbury regimes, not only have ensured the survival of the criminal apartheid system, which constitutes the most flagrant violation of human dignity, but have tried to impede the national liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa? Moreover, how can one understand the fact that they have not recognized the legitimate right to independence of the peoples of the Democratic Saharan Arab Republic and the Democratic Republic of East Timor? How, then, can the economic blockade against Cuba and the maintenance of a military base at Guantanamo against the will of the Cuban people be justified? How can one explain the failure to recognize the right of the Arab people of Palestine to recover their usurped homeland and set up an independent State and, at the same time, the massive support given to Israel, which enables it to occupy Arab lands, impose Israeli laws on Arab citizens and establish settlements on land which also is Arab? Furthermore, how can one justify support for the Fascist regimes of Latin America-in Chile, Nicaragua and Uruguay-in the face of the courageous struggle of the peoples concerned for their right to freedom? Where, then, is the morality of such champions? As we understand it, the campaign launched on this question is supposed to be against an alleged lack of freedoms in socialist countries, and hence is an attempt to discredit socialism.
16.	Since the People's Republic of Angola is an independent country on the African continent, it cannot fail to assume its growing responsibilities within the geopolitical context, both as regards the progressive development of political and economic relations and as regards the national liberation struggles.
17.	In this respect, our special attention centres on the situation prevailing in southern Africa. No one is unaware that the five Western members of the Security Council have for some time now been devoting certain efforts to finding a negotiated solution to the Namibian problem through numerous talks held with the« South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the front-line countries and the Fascist and racist Pretoria regime.
18.	After the Luanda Agreement of 12 July 1978,3 the requisite steps were taken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the progressive implementation of the decolonization programme for Namibia, as SWAPO has always shown a certain flexibility and a marked spirit of co-operation in order to achieve the desired solution. Moreover, SWAPO's proposal to sign a cease-fire with the Pretoria regime, which was duly authenticated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on behalf of the Security Council, is clear evidence of its firm intention to honour the commitments undertaken. However, faced with the imminence of a Security Council resolution, the Pretoria regime embarked on a series of shameless manoeuvres aimed at compromising the implementation of the decisions of that international body.
19.	In these circumstances the Government of the People's Republic of Angola considers that the unilateral decision of the Pretoria regime to hold early elections in Namibia is intended, as a minimum, to achieve the following purposes: to prevent at all costs the participation of SWAPO in a necessarily free and democratic electoral process; to impose a puppet government which would be constituted on a tribal basis and do its bidding, so as to prevent the transfer of power to SWAPO, the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people; to perpetuate the illegal occupation of Namibia and the inhuman exploitation of the people and natural resources of that Territory; to pursue its constant acts of provocation, violation and aggression against the People's Republic of Angola.
20.	At the same time, the Angolan Government also considers that the putting into effect of the Pretoria regime's pernicious designs to reject the decolonization plan for Namibia, as set forth in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), will have grave consequences, both inside and outside Namibia, which will be the entire responsibility of the five Western Powers if they do not decide to act with due and indispensable firmness-of which, moreover, they have never given proof—to ensure the strict application of the sanctions long advocated at various international conferences and in international bodies.
21.	In view of the possibility that the Governments of the five Western countries may show their habitual timid and hypocritical attitude in facing this insolent challenge to the international community, we think that the appropriate response is perfectly summarized in the ever-timely statement made more than a year ago by the far-sighted leader of the Angolan revolution, when he said:
""Only through armed struggle is it possible to defeat the oppressive forces in the world. It is not through negotiations, through conferences or councils, that the peoples will determine their own future, because there is a struggle of interests, a struggle between classes now developed through imperialism and through the desire of just one social group to dominate all the others. Without armed struggle, the national liberation struggle would have no vigour in it. It must therefore be intensified.""
22.	And, because the People's Republic of Angola is and will be by its own will a firm bastion of the revolution in Africa, no one should underrate its unshakeable determination to support SWAPO by all necessary means, and also the other national liberation movements, until such time
fully attained.
23.	The present evolution of the situation in Zimbabwe is no less disturbing. While it is true that the people of Zimbabwe, under the leadership of their legitimate representative the Patriotic Front, have achieved significant victories in their armed struggle for national liberation, it is no less true that there are ever more imperialist manoeuvres aimed at seeking to push aside the Patriotic Front or destroy it, to create differences among the front-line countries and to establish a neo-colonialist regime in Zimbabwe.
24.	It was on the basis of the connivance of certain imperialist Powers and their agents that the Fascist and racist Salisbury regime saw fit to resort to the farce of the so-called ""internal settlement"", and also saw fit to perpetrate systematic and criminal acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Mozambique and, albeit on a lesser scale, against the Republics of Zambia and Botswana.
25.	In these circumstances, winning national independence for Zimbabwe inevitably will be achieved through the continuous development of the armed struggle and, consequently, through the growing politico-military implantation of the Patriotic Front on its national territory. We reaffirm our unconditional, militant solidarity with it.
26.	In its turn, although under extremely difficult conditions the African National Congress of South Africa is pursuing its politico-military action against the Pretoria regime, which before long will have to face internally a truly explosive situation. To the Congress, the revolutionary vanguard of the South African people, we express our full support in its struggle against the, odious system of apartheid and in favour of national liberation.
27.	Within the context of decolonization, the total liberation of our continents and solidarity with the national liberation movements, there is a need for all Members of the United Nations to give serious thought to the courageous armed struggles of the peoples of Western Sahara, East Timor and Palestine, under the respective leadership of the Frente POLISARIO, FRETILIN and the PLO.
28.	Allow us to refer once again to the fundamental facts of the question of Western Sahara. The heroic armed struggle of the Saharan people constitutes the basis of permanent or growing tension among three non-aligned countries, and that has seriously affected the harmonious development of bilateral relations among some of our States.
29.	In the light of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), the right of the Saharan people to self-determination and independence is indisputable, and this, moreover, was officially recognized by the parties directly concerned until 1975.
30.	At the advisory hearing of the International Court of Justice held on 16 October 1975, it was clearly denied that there existed any ties of territorial sovereignty or any form of uninterrupted exercise of political authority, by any country whatsoever, over Western Sahara prior to Spanish colonization.
31.	The mission sent to the Western Sahara by the United Nations in 1975 clearly stated in its report  that the people of the Territory whom they met were virtually unanimously In favour of independence and also recognized that the Frente POLISARIO was the predominant political force, thus acknowledging its representative character,
32.	Finally, the Madrid Agreement of 15 November 1975 was reached without Spain, the then administering Power having previously consulted the Saharan people. For these reasons, it is clear to us that any territorial claim over the Western Sahara is therefore illegitimate.
33.	Although we still hope that a just solution will be found within the framework of the OAU, through the work of the ad hoc Committee composed of five Heads of State of the OAU and the holding of a special summit on the question of the Western Sahara'0 we are convinced that it is now necessary, by means of negotiations and with the full participation of the Frente POLISARIO, to face up to the inevitable political solution, so as to safeguard the Saharan people's right to national existence and to preserve the region from foreign intervention.
34.	In East Timor the situation is very similar to that in the Western Sahara. When the administering colonial Power withdrew, the Maubere people, already for some years under the leadership of their legitimate representative, FRETILIN, were preparing to assume full power, when suddenly foreign armed forces belonging to a member country of, the non-aligned movement invaded East Timor and occupied the capital despite the proclamation of the Democratic Republic of East Timor.
35.	Since 1975 the armed struggle has been considerably intensified. Despite the progressive increase of invading military contingents, which now number some tens of thousands of troops, and also despite the lack of external logistic base and the inconceivable passivity of the progressive community as regards military and financial help for the FRETILIN fighters, the Maubere people, relying on their own forces, undoubtedly control the greater part of the national territory.
36.	It is important to note that after three years of war the. invading armed forces have not succeeded in eliminating or crushing FRETILIN, nor have they been able to beat them back further than about 30 kilometres from the capital. It is therefore imperative that the United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the non-aligned movement itself address themselves seriously to the grave situation existing in East Timor and that the democratic and progressive forces of the world express militant solidarity with the Maubere people.
37.	At the same time, the gravity of the present crisis in the Middle East also merits particular attention in view of the high degree of tension and the military confrontations in that area. We are wholly convinced that this deplorable situation will continue so long as the legitimate rights of the
Arab people of Palestine to recover their homeland usurped by Israel and to establish an independent State are not recognized. At the same time, we believe that without the participation of the PLO in any negotiations on a solution to the problem it will not be possible to solve that grave conflict.
38.	For these reasons it does not seem to us that the bilateral Camp David agreements  arrived at under the tendentious auspices of the Carter Administration can contribute to a just and lasting solution to this crisis that would accord with the interests of the Arab peoples as a whole and of the Palestinian people in particular.
39.	The permanent hostility of the Israeli regime and the impunity it enjoys owing to the massive support it receives from North American imperialism, which permits it to commit multiple acts of aggression against certain Arab countries, prevents us from being able to conclude that these two could one day favour the just cause of the Arab peoples to the detriment of the sordid objectives of the imperialist Powers in that area, where Israel is the operative tool.
40.	The heroic people of Viet Nam, an exemplary source of inspiration for all peoples fighting for national liberation, are today suffering fresh and treacherous aggression and provocations which barely conceal patently expansionist designs. We thus reaffirm our unshakable militant solidarity with the just and well considered positions taken with the aim of solving present conflicts through the correct method of negotiation.
41.	To the fighting people of Korea we express our total support for their persistent intention to reunify their country by peaceful means and without any foreign interference in their internal affairs.
42.	To the people of Puerto Rico we convey our full solidarity and our warmest congratulations on the victories recently achieved, as reflected in the recent resolution of the Special Committee reaffirming their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, including the complete transfer of all powers to the people of that territory.
43.	To the Chilean people we reaffirm our unconditional support for their just struggle to recover their human dignity, freedom and independence.
44.	We express our most heartfelt solidarity with the people of Nicaragua and their fighting vanguard in the courageous struggle they have been waging to achieve their legitimate aspirations.
45.	And, since the policy of non-alignment identifies with the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples, it is fitting here to hail the holding in Cuba of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and to express our conviction that that Conference"" will

46.	The People's Republic of Angola will shortly be commemorating the third anniversary of the proclamation of its independence, and in assessing the efforts already made in this short period we can note with legitimate pride, as an example, that, in the field of education, one out of every three Angolans is studying. The number of pupils receiving primary education has tripled in comparison with that in the colonial era, and in secondary education the number has doubled. One hundred and sixty thousand young people and adults have already become literate, and 600,000 are taking literacy courses. In the People's Republic of Angola education is free of charge.
47.	In the field of health., all medical and health care is also free of charge. Substantial efforts are being made to ensure that such care gives the best possible coverage to the rural areas of our country.
48.	With regard to agriculture, the basic factor, and that of industry, the decisive factor, the state production"" units have been progressively increasing their output, thanks to the selfless efforts of our peasants and workers.
49.	In the fields of construction, transport and fisheries, the results already achieved are quite significant.
50.	Yet, the levels attained do not as yet correspond to the targets set because, among other things, it has not been possible to compensate for the material damage sustained because of the invasion of South African armed forces, which is estimated at $6.7 billion and for which compensation has not yet been forthcoming.
51.	The people of Angola, their Party and their Government are enthusiastically pursuing the tasks of national reconstruction in order to consolidate the revolutionary process, strengthen national unity and defence, establish the Party structures throughout the country and build the foundations for a socialist society.
52.	The struggle continues; victory is certain.







"
AGO,1990,"﻿First I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session and to join those who spoke before me in wishing you success.
Even though the international community is more hopeful today about finding the most efficient ways and means in the guest for justice, peace, understanding and co-operation, we know that the task of leading our proceedings is a hard one. Nevertheless, your wisdom, diplomatic experience and capability, as well as your personal dedication, are an assurance that the work of this session will be most successful.
Allow me, therefore, to express, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and on my own behalf, the trust, we have in you, and to assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation.
Allow me also to congratulate the outgoing President, His Excellency General Joseph Garba, on the excellent work carried out during the forty-fourth session. The success of the sixteenth special session, devoted to the subject of apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa, and of the eighteenth special session, on international economic co-operation, particularly for the recovery of economic growth and development in the developing countries, is unequivocal proof of the dedication and capability that have always characterized him.
The current trend towards détente in international relations has resulted in important steps aimed at solving some of the major problems of concern to the international community, thanks to the efforts made during the past few years, when the cold war has been increasingly replaced by dialogue, and the use of force in relations between States has been losing ground to the settlement of conflicts through negotiation.
In this connection, we salute Namibia's accession to independence, an event that marked the end of the era of traditional colonialism on the African continent.
We also welcome the unification of Germany, a country with which we have always had friendly relations. My Government will spare no effort to maintain and strengthen those ties of co-operation.
These historic events are occurring concurrently with others which have a profound significance for Africa and the world: the freeing of Dr. Nelson Mandela, the legalisation of anti-apartheid political organizations and the transformations taking place in South Africa with a view to the abolition of the policy of racial segregation. All these are signs of the new environment in which we are living and of hope for a better future.
However, elements of instability persist in southern Africa. We are referring to the situation of violence which obtains in South Africa, supported and encouraged by the police.
We are also referring to the conflicts in Angola and Mozambique, where peace efforts are being opposed by external interference, whose only reason for being lies in the outmoded policies of bloc confrontation.
In the case of Angolan, the summit meeting held one year ago at Gbadolite had created hopes for peace that quickly disappeared as a result of the continued support given to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) by the United States and by South African conservative circles.
Throughout this period, the Government of Angola has reaffirmed its dedication to go on with peace efforts through the dialogue aimed at national unity and reconciliation among all Angolans. It was in that contest that concessions were made in Gbadolite and on other occasions.
The same cannot be said of UNITA, which not only has deliberately violated and later unilaterally denounced the commitments made at Gbadolite but also has intensified its acts of war, particularly against the economic and social infrastructure, and has kidnapped and murdered defenceless civilians. Nevertheless, the Government of Angola continued to bet on peace and therefore has decided to establish direct contacts with UNITA.
Notwithstanding that flexibility, the continued foreign interference and the position of UNITA vis-à-vis the Angolan Government's proposals for achieving peace Lave been the obstacles that prevented the four rounds of direct talks already held under the auspices of the Government of Portugal from producing the expected results.
The failure of the fourth round of direct talks was due to UNITA’s unjustified demand to be explicitly recognised as an opposition political party. The Angolan Government has already established the principle of constitutional revision and of a multi-party system in Angola under peaceful conditions, proposing a temporary status for UNITA that, once agreed to by that group, would take effect with the signing of the cease-fire. Once a multi-party system has been instituted, all political forces would conduct their activities legally under the Political Parties Law, to be approved by the competent State authorities. 
Therefore, it is wrong to demand the status of an opposition political party in the present circumstances, not only because it violates the present legal and constitutional order, recognised by UMITA during the second round of negotiations, but also because nowhere in the world does an official opposition party possess an army of its own.
The attempt to blame the Angolan Government for the failure of the fourth round is intended simply to manipulate public opinion and justify additional aid to UNITA for continuing the war in Angola. Unfortunately the political, economic and military might of the United States continues to influence Angola's internal conflict, contrary to the commitments made by United States authorities during the negotiation process that led to the New York agreements on peace in south-western Africa.
It is not inappropriate to emphasise the seriousness demonstrated by the Government of the People's Republic of Angola in the process that facilitated the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), making it possible to eliminate the tension point represented by the Namibian conflict. At the same time, it would be unfair not to recognise the important role played by the Cuban Government for peace in south-Western Africa.
Angola and Cuba continue to abide by their commitments on the phased withdrawal of troops from Angola, in a process that has already resulted in the departure of more than 38,000 soldiers in a shorter period of time than had been agreed upon.
The war situation in the People's Republic of Angola is made worse by natural disasters, particularly the drought that has been afflicting some central and southern regions of the country for about four years, with serious material damage and loss of human life. According to present estimates about 3.5 million people are in need of emergency food aid and 2.2 million of them are suffering the effects of the drought.
We are grateful for the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in mobilizing emergency aid to Angola, and we thank the international community for alleviating the suffering of the stricken populations.
However, in the face of the difficulties and limitations inherent in the country's economic underdevelopment, the Angolan Government is unable to cope with that natural disaster by means of its own resources, and for that reason it is renewing its appeal for international aid.
Given the interdependence that exists nowadays in the world, no country can remain indifferent to problems that affect humanity. The People's Republic of Angola takes a keen interest in the events taking place in various parts of the globe.
The latest developments in Western Sahara show that some positive steps are being taken to break the present stalemate. The Government of the People's Republic of Angola reaffirms the right of the Saharan people to self-determination and encourages the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front to proceed with negotiations and congratulates the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the efforts he has undertaken, together with the Organization of African Unity (OAU), to organize a referendum that can bring an early settlement of the conflict.
The continued illegal occupation of the Territory of East Timor is unacceptable, unjustifiable and a violation of the norms and principles of international law, especially when it is perpetrated by a country which in the past has itself been a victim of colonialism and which has made an important contribution to the struggle of colonized peoples for their emancipation. 
My Government advocates the path of dialogue between Portugal and Indonesia, including representatives of the people of East Timor, as the way to find a fair and comprehensive solution that will take account of the legitimate rights of the Maubere people.
Prospects in the Middle East are not encouraging in so far as finding an early resolution of the Israeli-Arab conflict is concerned. We believe that settling Jews in occupied Arab territories will not help in any way to bring an honourable end to that conflict. The Government of the People's Republic of Angola considers it imperative to convene an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), the authentic representative of the Palestinian people, which has for decades been struggling for its right to self-determination.
We cannot fail to mention the crisis that recently arose in the Persian Gulf. When everything points to a realisation that resorting to the use of force is not the most efficient way or means of resolving conflicts, we are surprised by the events in that part of our globe with the invasion oil Kuwait by Iraq - soma thing we emphatically condemn, especially since Kuwait is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement which, since its establishment, has defended the principle of refraining from the threat or use of force in international relations.
Therefore the parties involved must honour the resolutions of the Security Council and It is imperative that Iraqi troops should be withdrawn from Kuwait in order to facilitate a peaceful and negotiated resolution of the conflict.
With regard to Central America, we reaffirm that the peoples of the region must freely decide their destiny; there must be no external interference through support given to irregular armed groups, through direct military Intervention or through a war of information whose object is to overthrow legitimately constituted Governments. 
In Cambodia the continued armed actions from neighbouring territories will not advance the search for a peace agreement. My government believe that a peaceful resolution to the conflict necessarily requires the cessation of all foreign interference and respect for the country’s independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned status.   
On the subject of Korea, my Government supports the steps taken towards the reunification of the two parts of that country and the removal of foreign bases and troops from the peninsula. The recent proposals aimed at the holding of a conference during a first phase constitute a positive sign that deserves the fullest support from the international community, for no matter what manoeuvres are resorted to, a people with a single identity will never remain divided.
At the beginning of the last decade, we declared from this rostrum our firm desire to improve the global economic environment, and we likewise committed ourselves to strengthening international economic co-operation in order to conquer hunger, poverty, malnutrition and epidemics - that is, to overcome the problems of underdevelopment and give more dignity to a man’s existence.
Today, as we enter the last decade of the twentieth century, we should reflect on what was our commitment to searching for solutions to the critical international economic situation, which affects the developing countries mort of all. Therefore, it is only right to raise some concerns Must we have images of hunger and poverty continue to appear in the world of our discussions in order to remind us of the imbalance and injustice of the present international economic system? Do we need to repeat at every stop that four fifth· of the world's population possesses only one fifth of its total wealth, manages only 10 per cent of the world’s industrial output and controls no more than 2 to 3 per cent of the total research efforts in the world? What specific joint measures did we take to prevent the gap between the developing and the developed countries from reaching today’s proportions?
When the recant special session, of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation analysed the results achieved  during the past decade, it found that the problem which had already caused concern to the countries of the so-called third world at the start of the decade were still present.
The target level of official development aid to the developing countries, fixed at 0.7 per cent of the industrialised countries gross national product (GDP), was attained only by a small group of countries, and the general figure was only 0.35 per cent. 
In international trade we continue to witness a surge of protectionism practised by the developed countries, e decline in the prices of raw materials and a deterioration of the terms of trade, whose effects seriously compromise all the efforts made by the  developing countries to revive their economies.
To aggravate this picture, the foreign debt of the developing countries has been constantly increasing, reaching the monumental sum of $1,320 billion at the end of last year; that amount cannot be paid without inevitably diminishing the investment capacity of those countries.
In our view, the basic question lies in the need for a political will, both on the part of the developing countries and on the part of the developed countries, as the only way to avoid a reproduction of the system that generated the inequalities and injustices.
While it is true that in order to overcome the challenges of the world economic situation, the developing countries have to adopt more appropriate strategies geared to readjusting their economies, it is equally true that the developed countries should adopt acre constructive attitudes.
More recently^ with the ongoing transformations is Eastern Europe we have witnessed what could be called ""conditionalism"" in connection with official development aid from the countries of Western Europe.
For the Government of the People's Republic of Angola, the economic evolution occurring in the countries of Eastern Europe should signify a more active participation by those countries in the world economy, so that they may make a greater contribution to the improvement of North-South relations.
In the particular case of Africa, the changes taking place in Eastern Europe should serve as an incentive to other Industrialised countries to give greater support to African countries, taking account of the ongoing policies of structural adjustment aimed at the recovery of their economies, instead of opting for measures that would further worsen their participation in the expansion of the world economy.
Moreover, in the face of the inadequate results achieved in implementing the United Nations programme for the economic recovery of Africa, the international community has seen the birth of a new plan that requires greater flexibility on the part of donors.
In southern Africa, with the accession of Namibia to independence and the beginning of the process that will lead to negotiations between anti-apartheid organisations and the South African Government, new prospects are opening for the region's development.
The member countries of the Co-ordination Conference for the Development of Southern Africa, in its tenth year of existence are entering a new phase in the development efforts that will need the growing support of the international community.
Important events have taken place and will take place during the present decade. A few days ago the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries ended at Paris with encouraging - albeit partial - results. Its convening constitutes one more opportunity to seek solutions to the pressing problems faced by that group of countries. The cancellation of their foreign debts by the industrialised creditor countries should be considered one of the most urgent and necessary measures for achieving that end.
The World Summit for Children, held on 29 and 30 September, accurately analysed the problems that beset the world's children and it recommended appropriate measures for their protection. The People's Republic of Angola reaffirms its most fir, commitment to such principles and will do its utmost to improve the living conditions of children. 
In addition, the eight United nations conference on development will take place in 1991, in 1992 there will be a conference on environment and development, and in 1994 a conference of population. At those important forums an efforts will be made to continue the debate begun at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation. The results we expect from those meetings should become a foundation for re-establishing trust among nations.  
"
AGO,1997,"﻿On behalf of the
Republic of Angola, allow me first to congratulate the
President, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, on his election to
preside over the fifty-second session of the General
Assembly.
Allow me also to congratulate the outgoing
President, Ambassador Razali Ismail, on the excellent
work he performed.
We should also like to express our appreciation to
the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his dedication
and determination in turning the United Nations into a
more effective instrument to meet the challenges of the
twenty-first century.
The cold war, which was the main obstacle that for
decades prevented the United Nations from performing its
role fully, a role defined by its founding Members in the
Charter, is now a thing of the past. But our world
Organization has not yet achieved the degree of efficiency
that the Member countries and their people would desire,
with the result that sometimes despair and a lack of
confidence are felt, instead of trust in its efforts.
The construction of the new democratic world order
to which we all aspire will demand that the principal
forum for multilateral diplomacy, the United Nations, play
a greater role. In this context, the complete restructuring
and revitalization of its system and an end to the present
financial crisis, which is affecting its normal functioning,
are essential.
The issue of the restructuring of the Security Council
should therefore be given priority. The current structure
of that body is obsolete, reflecting a reality that prevailed
more than 50 years ago. How is it conceivable that
27


regions such as the African continent, which makes up the
largest regional group at the United Nations, or Latin
America, are not represented among the permanent
Members of the Security Council? Therefore, it is high time
that the geographical composition of that body be
overhauled to allow for more balanced and more equitable
representation. In this regard, Angola endorses the African
claim for no fewer than two seats among the permanent
members of the Security Council. The Council’s working
methods should also be revised in order to ensure greater
transparency in its decision-making processes.
Angola supports the declaration made by the Heads of
State of the Organization of African Unity, as well as the
statement made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the
non-aligned countries on reform of the Security Council.
The recent proposals made by the Secretary-General
on reform will certainly boost the process of overhauling
the United Nations. Angola welcomes the contents of those
proposals, although we would have preferred to see further
improvements in some aspects. We are, however, optimistic
as to the outcome.
As the Assembly is aware, the Lusaka Protocol which
was signed in 1994 between the Government and the armed
opposition, UNITA, was intended to solve the post-electoral
crisis provoked by UNITA and at the same time to put the
country back on the path towards peace, national
reconciliation and democracy. However, approximately
three years since the beginning of its implementation,
Angola is still far from achieving those goals due to the
systematic failures by UNITA to meet its obligations and to
its repeated delaying tactics. This is a clear demonstration
of bad faith and lack of political will by its leadership. It
appears that the leader of this organization has not
abandoned its strategy of taking power by force. He is still
resisting the transformation of UNITA into a true political
party and UNITA’s complete demilitarization, even though
the single national army, which includes in its ranks
thousands of men provided by UNITA, has already been
formed.
UNITA still maintains a private, heavily armed army
made up of around 35,000 men, 4,000 of whom belong to
the UNITA leader’s personal guard. This constitutes a
serious violation of the Lusaka Protocol and is the main
cause of the current climate of tension and insecurity in
some parts of Angola. The members of this army include
troops that UNITA hid from the United Nations during the
quartering process, recently demobilized UNITA troops
who have been recruited again by force, and former
soldiers of the former Republic of Zaire.
At the same time, UNITA is still continuing its
military build-up through the reactivation of military
bases and acquisition of sophisticated weapons from
foreign countries, in clear contradiction of paragraph 19
of Security Council resolution 864 (1993).
On the other hand, UNITA is holding on to large
portions of national territory which were supposed to be
handed over to government administration. This is
impeding exercise of the State’s sovereignty throughout
the country and the free movement of people and goods.
The control of some of these areas is aimed at exploring
for, and then smuggling and exploiting, their natural
resources to finance UNITA’s war machinery and satisfy
the individual interests of its leadership.
As a result of these actions, the perspectives created
with the inauguration of the Government of National
Unity and Reconciliation and the swearing-in of the
Parliament have been postponed.
UNITA’s behaviour in the peace process is
repugnant as well as ambiguous. It insists on armed
opposition despite the fact that it is part of the main
power institutions and despite the fact that Angola has a
democratic, pluralist system in which all political parties
can freely carry out their activities.
The international community has already expressed,
repeatedly and categorically, its condemnation of and
dismay at UNITA’s actions. In 1993 the Security Council
applied the first package of restrictive measures against
UNITA. More recently, the Security Council unanimously
adopted resolution 1127 (1997), which applies a new
package of measures against UNITA as a result of its lack
of cooperation in the implementation of the Lusaka
Protocol. The position taken by the Council above all
displays the concern of the international community and
its determination to prevent the UNITA leadership
strategy from being implemented. Otherwise, peace and
stability in Angola and the entire region of central and
southern Africa would be at risk.
The Government of Angola reiterates its firm
support for resolution 1127 (1997), because we feel that
it is a strong means of pressure aimed at dissuading
UNITA from its intention to return to war, encouraging
it to speed up its demilitarization and transformation into
28


a political party, and put an end to its jurisdiction over parts
of Angolan territory.
Taking the above into account, the Angolan people
look forward to the Security Council’s demonstrating
firmness and determination in implementing resolution 1127
(1997), immediately putting into force sanctions against
UNITA unless that organization changes its behaviour and
gives proof of good faith in complying with its outstanding
obligations.
The Government of Angola is optimistic about the
successful conclusion of the peace process and will
continue to do its utmost to guarantee the full
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol.
Before turning to another subject, I would like to
express the sincerest gratitude of the Government of Angola
to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Angola, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, and to the
Governments of the troika of observers, Portugal, Russia
and the United States, for their untiring efforts to bring
about peace in Angola.
Recent changes in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo have contributed to alleviating the tensions in the
central African region, opening new perspectives for its
States and peoples in terms of stability and development.
The present climate will allow stability to prevail in
the region and will allow for better coordination among
States with a view to reinforcing the observance of the
principle of good neighbourliness.
The Angolan Government is very apprehensive
regarding the crisis in the Republic of the Congo, a country
with which Angola shares a common border, close
consanguinity and historic ties.
The Republic of Angola favours a negotiated solution
to the crisis and supports the international mediation efforts
headed by Mr. Omar Bongo, President of the Republic of
Gabon. Our Government also supports the deployment of
an international force as soon as a political settlement
emerges from the negotiations.
In Sierra Leone, we deplore the interruption of the
democratic process and the overthrow of the legitimately
elected institutions. The Government of Angola supports the
efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and, in
particular, of neighbouring countries to restore the
democratic institutions.
We are also concerned with the situation in the
Republic of the Comoros, where tensions are threatening
the country’s independence and territorial integrity. We
encourage the international community to support the
efforts of the OAU in the search for a peaceful solution
able to preserve the territorial integrity and independence
of that country.
The situation in Somalia continues to deteriorate, and
a solution acceptable to all the parties concerned has yet
to be found. The Angolan Government approves of the
efforts made by member countries of the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
and, in particular, the most recent initiatives of Ethiopia
in bringing the representatives of the Somali factions
together at the negotiating table.
Of particular concern to us is the ostracism displayed
in the main international forums with regard to the Somali
crisis.
In Western Sahara the recent opening of direct
negotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the
Frente POLISARIO front is a positive sign. The Angolan
Government has always been in favour of a negotiated
solution to the conflict which takes into account the
aspirations of the populations of the territory and
encourages the parties to honour the agreements signed in
Houston and to continue the ongoing dialogue in good
faith. In this connection, we support the joint efforts of
the OAU and the United Nations.
We are concerned with the continuation of the
Israeli-Arab conflict, the primary cause of the
deteriorating situation in the Middle East. Recent events
have delayed the peace process and have led to further
deterioration of the situation in the region. Angola
reaffirms its support for the peace process in the Middle
East. Its success depends upon the reinforcement of
mutual trust and the full implementation of the accords
signed between the parties concerned.
We endorse the position expressed in the Declaration
of the Heads of State or Government of the OAU and the
statement made in New Delhi at the ministerial meeting
of the Non-Aligned Movement with regard to the question
of Palestine.
My Government expresses its concern at the lack of
progress in the initiatives to bring about a just solution to
the question of East Timor. The Government of Angola
29


deplores the refusal by one of the parties to accept
President Mandela’s initiative.
The economic, commercial and financial embargo
imposed on Cuba is a matter of concern to my Government,
particularly because of its negative impact on the economic
and social situation of the Cuban people. We reiterate our
appeal to have the embargo lifted, which will contribute to
relations between two peoples.
(spoke in English)
Finally, I should like to thank those who have given
me the opportunity to speak today. As the Assembly knows,
my speech was to be delivered on 26 September. However,
due to a sad event which has happened in my country, I
have to leave tonight, and I was obliged to ask the
Assembly to give me the opportunity to deliver my speech
today.
One of our colleagues, the former of Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Angola, passed away yesterday. It is my
duty to return home to pay my respects to my dear
colleague. Many here know Foreign Minister ""Loy"".
I wish the Assembly well, and may good work be
done here for peace, stability and international cooperation.









"
AGO,2017,"On	behalf of the
Government of the Republic of Angola, allow me to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajcak on having been elected to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second session and to assure him of Angola’s full support in the fulfilment of his mission, so that he may successfully provide us with the leadership we need at this time.
I also congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the Assembly at its seventy-first session, on the capable manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session; and Mr. Antonio Guterres on his appointment to the post of Secretary-General. Allow me to wish Mr. Guterres every success in his mandate and assure him of the full support and cooperation of Angola.
As has been reiterated several times in this forum, peace and security are fundamental premises for stability, sustainable development, democracy and the promotion of and respect for human rights. The theme chosen for this session — “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet” — is timely and compels us to collectively reflect on the actions of the United Nations to solve the main problems affecting humankind.
We need an Organization capable of promoting international peace and security by acting swiftly to prevent potential conflict situations, improving the global strategy to combat international terrorism, and placing economic and social development issues at the centre of its action. In this context, we appreciate the relevance of the four axes defined in the agenda of this session, namely, the prevention and mediation of conflicts to achieve sustainable peace, the promotion of human rights, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
We reiterate Angola’s support for the Secretary- General’s proposals for reforms with a view to revitalizing and rationalizing the resources of the Organization. The United Nations should act as the first instance in the promotion of peace diplomacy at the global level.
We also reiterate the need to reform the Security Council in order to have it reflect the reality of the contemporary world. Its current composition is outdated and needs to be urgently reformed. In line with the African position represented in the Ezulwini Consensus, Angola reiterates the need to increase the number of permanent members to ensure a fair geographical balance. It is unfair that the African continent, which accounts for almost 40 per cent of the States Members of the United Nations, is not represented among the permanent members in the main organ in charge of maintaining peace and security in the world.
Angola underlines the importance of multilateralism in solving global problems, in accordance with the logic of shared responsibility and benefits, in recognition of the legitimate interests of all and in concertation towards realistic solutions. Angola’s attachment to multilateralism is strongly emphasized in its role in solving problems that threaten peace and security on the African continent, particularly in the Great Lakes region.
In the context of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, Angola has been leading diplomatic efforts, with its regional and international partners, to find a lasting political solution capable of guaranteeing security, stability, economic and social development, and democracy for the countries and peoples of the region. This joint engagement has allowed for a substantial reduction of tensions in the region, with notable advances such as the continuation of the inter-Burundi dialogue, encouraging signs in the resolution of the political crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and positive developments in the peace process in the Central African Republic, which have made it possible to hold elections in the country leading to the normalization of its institutions.
Despite these advances, we still have a long way to go on the path towards fully stabilizing that part of our continent, and the parties involved carry the main responsibility for ending the violence, respecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the citizens of their respective countries, and building their national political institutions. In this context, they must demonstrate through action their commitment to and engagement with peace agreements and other political platforms either negotiated directly or sponsored by regional institutions and the international community.
The international community’s collective action under the auspices of the United Nations should also cover the fight against terrorism. In this fight, a significant part of our effort should be directed at combating the causes of terrorism and violent extremism, which reside, inter alia, in the social crises in and the institutional fragility of many States. The case of Libya is a blatant example of this reality.
The African continent has been at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, which has killed innocent civilians, caused extensive damage to property and destroyed the way of life of many of its countries. Angola fully supports the efforts of the African Union, with the assistance of its international partners, to confront the scourge of terrorism.
Two years ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — an important instrument to guide the development strategies of our States. We hope that its implementation over the next 13 years will substantially reduce the major social deficiencies affecting developing nations in particular. The economic and financial difficulties affecting most countries have had a negative impact on the mobilization of financial resources for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, especially among the poorest, most vulnerable countries with limited internal resources. International efforts aimed at securing critical financial resources should be guided by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, adopted in 2015.
The Republic of Angola, which is now beginning a new cycle in its life as a nation, is strongly engaged in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, despite an adverse global economic environment. To that end, Angola has launched its national development plan, aimed at rehabilitating and modernizing economic and social infrastructure, promoting public and private investment, and enhancing training, qualification and the adequate management of human resources.
The world is moving towards consensus in recognizing the urgency of combating climate change. To this end, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is extremely important in the development of enabling tools for protecting the right to development and strengthening resilience in developing countries. Angola views the Agreement as a historic commitmentand an encouragement to contain global warming and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The urgent need for the world to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement has been dramatically highlighted by the recent climate-related disasters in various parts of the world. Angola joins in solidarity with the victims in the Caribbean, Mexico, the United States and other parts of the world.
In order to address this and other challenges facing the international community, Angola will continue to be a safe and responsible partner of the United Nations and contribute to the implementation of its agenda in an engaged manner. We are increasingly able and fit to play a decisive role in restoring peace and security, particularly in Africa, as well as in furthering its economic development. To that end, Angola has remained stable, and the pacification of the country has definitely been achieved.
The Republic of Angola recently held its third general elections in peacetime, in a climate of tranquillity, respect for differences and great civility, demonstrating the stability prevailing in the country and that the gradual consolidation of democracy is a fact. The priorities of the new Government will focus on economic development with particular attention on combating poverty, reducing inequalities, combating unemployment, and improving governance insufficiencies and development indicators as a sine qua non for building a prosperous and democratic society.
Regrettably, peace is still not prevalent in many regions. Concerning Guinea-Bissau, a country linked to Angola by historical and brotherly ties, we remain confident and expectant regarding the resolution of the political impasse. In this regard, we strongly support the efforts of all the Guinean, regional and international political and social actors, including the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the United Nations, the European Union and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries.
The issue of Western Sahara continues to merit the due attention of the United Nations to ensure the effective implementation of the relevant Security Council and African Union resolutions. Angola encourages the main parties involved to continue the dialogue in order to resolve the dispute, which has lasted too long.
In the Middle East, we are concerned about the impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Angola argues that the solution lies in the acceptance and existence of two States, living side by side in peace and security.
The tension we are now witnessing in the Korean peninsula poses a very serious threat to international peace and security. Angola joins the voices advocating for a diplomatic solution and compliance with international non-proliferation instruments. The peoples of the region deserve to live in peace and not haunted by the spectre of a conflict whose effects would be devastating and unacceptable to the human conscience.
Angola promptly welcomed the steps taken to normalize relations between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America, which will benefit the two peoples. The complete lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo would contribute significantly to easing tensions between the two countries and would eliminate one of the last remnants of the Cold War. This would also bring about a more stable and peaceful environment for development in the Latin American region. This unilateral measure — the embargo — limits the Cuban people’s enjoyment of development, and its extraterritorial effects violate the principles and norms of international law.
The promotion and protection of human rights have always been at the forefront of Angola’s foreign priorities, as evidenced by the fact that it is a party to the main international human rights instruments and maintains an exemplary cooperation and ongoing dialogue with United Nations human rights mechanisms. It is in this context that Angola is a candidate for a seat on the Human Rights Council in the elections that will take place in October 2017. We look forward to participating actively in and contributing to the protection of human rights in the regions and countries most affected by violations of these rights. In this regard, we would highly appreciate the support of the members of the Assembly for our candidacy.
I would like to conclude by urging Member States to renew their confidence in the United Nations and strengthen international dialogue as a key element of a culture of peace, respect for differences among peoples, conflict prevention and the foundations of progress and development, to which all the peoples of the world have the right and are entitled.
"
AGO,1983,"﻿149 .  It is a particular pleasure for me to express to you, Sir, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola, our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a high tribute to your country, Panama, but it is also a reflection of your acknowledged remarkable diplomatic skill. We wish you the greatest success in carrying out your great responsibilities.
150.	Allow us to take this opportunity to convey to Mr. Imre Hollai our great appreciation for the far-sighted and dignified way in which he carried out his mandate from the very beginning of the thirty-seventh session.
151.	We should like also to reiterate our keen appreciation of the devotion of the Secretary-General to the fundamental principles of the United Nations and of his important contribution to the search for just solutions commensurate with the serious problems confronting the international community.
152.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Angola would like at this point to congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission to membership of the United Nations.
153.	Each year, when a new session of the General Assembly is convened, we all come here to reaffirm our commitment to the noble purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to reiterate our devotion to the cause of freedom, peace, justice, democracy, solidarity, development and co-operation.
154.	At the beginning of their statements, the speakers —almost invariably—stress that the General Assembly session is taking place at a very critical moment, for the international situation has badly deteriorated, to the point of seriously threatening the survival of mankind.
155.	But it is undeniable that there is an ever-widening gap between fine words or good intentions and action. All of us merely repeat ourselves annually, thus putting to the test the tolerance, or resistance, of our auditors and the credibility of those who speak before this Assembly.
156.	On several occasions, from this very rostrum, we have made no secret of the deep concern of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola over the impotence or resignation of competent international bodies or their abdication of their responsibility to face up to the proliferation of hotbeds of tension, which are kindled, directly or indirectly, by the imperialist Powers.
157.	No one here can be unaware of the causes of and the agents responsible for this grim international picture. We repeat the question: how long will the peoples and Governments that cherish peace and justice have to wait before the existing United Nations bodies—which are adequate to the task—truly shoulder their responsibilities and firmly take the most effective measures, which they do indeed have at their disposal, against those who violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations; against those who carry on colonial wars and foment all sorts of acts of aggression, direct or indirect, the victims being States that take independent, progressive positions; against those who engage in the economic plunder of underdeveloped countries and who persist in preventing the gradual reduction of the gap which exists between the rich or developed countries and the poor or underdeveloped countries; against those who deliberately hinder the serious efforts of the socialist countries and the progressive, democratic forces to achieve detente, general and complete disarmament, and a comprehensive prohibition of the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons; against those who stimulate the arms race, thus ensuring fabulous profits for their military industries and leading to faster increases in military budgets and expenditures; against those who engage in an ever-increasing number of gigantic military manoeuvres which are intended to intimidate certain peoples or States, or even to carry out acts of aggression against them; against those who do not respect relevant resolutions or decisions of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Non-Aligned Movement and the OAU; against those who undermine the authority of the Secretary-General and his efforts to carry out his great responsibilities by failing to provide him with all the means of which he has need; and against those who threaten international peace and security through military intervention and illegal occupation of territories, through interference in the internal affairs of other States and through a lack of respect for the principles of non-use of force and the settlement of disputes by means of negotiations?
158.	All these things, but especially the unbridled arms race and the threat of a nuclear war, involve huge expenditures, thus accelerating inflation, causing large budget deficits and further reducing the already decreasing volume of economic assistance to the underdeveloped countries. This has greatly contributed to the present economic crisis, which can be solved only by taking effective measures to establish the new international economic order advocated several years ago by the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries.
159.	Given this alarming situation, which clearly threatens the future of the peoples, and given the growing tragedy of the millions of human beings still deprived of their freedom and the right to choose their own destiny and without any means of resisting servitude, humiliation, tyranny, poverty, famine, ignorance and disease, it is imperative that at this session the General Assembly dedicate itself to the search for effective solutions to the problems afflicting mankind.
160.	We feel that the situation in southern Africa deserves the very special attention of this session of the General Assembly, in that we are witnessing a dangerous escalation of aggression by the racist, fascist Pretoria regime against the front-line countries, and especially against the People's Republic of Angola.
161.	The persistent efforts of the apartheid regime to increase its military potential and even to acquire an arsenal of nuclear weapons is one further proof of its sinister projects, which are designed to perpetuate colonialism in South Africa and deprive the overwhelming majority of the South African people of their freedom and their political, economic and social rights, so as to keep them subjected to the white minority; to maintain the illegal occupation of Namibia and to destabilize the front-line countries, employing for that purpose armed 
puppets. The complicity of certain Western countries and Israel with the South African regime in these areas, as well as the investments and economic assistance with which those countries provide South Africa, cannot help but encourage the Pretoria regime in its stubbornness and in its role of the policeman of imperialism.
162.	Everybody here knows that South African aggression against the People's Republic of Angola goes back to August 1975. Everybody knows too that South African troops invaded Angola several weeks before the proclamation of independence, which was scheduled for 11 November 1975. Everybody knows also that the racist and fascist Pretoria regime, encouraged by the militarist, warlike policy of the present United States Administration, put into operation a mysterious plan entitled  Operation Proteus , which resulted in a new invasion and the occupation since 23 August 1981 of a considerable area of the province of Cunene.
163.	To this day, reconnaissance flights, aerial bombardments, helicopter troop operations, land bombardments and attacks, mining operations and acts of sabotage against the Angolan economic infrastructure are gradually increasing. A certain number of villages are today either in ruins or are mere remnants of what they were in the past.
164.	The disturbing dimension of the escalation of South African acts of aggression has become even more clear through the attack on the village of Cangamba in the province of Moxico, 500 kilometres from the frontier with Namibia. Between 2 and 8 August, six battalions, made up of UNIT A   bands of South African commandos and of mercenaries, supported by heavy artillery, carried out several attacks against Cangamba, which is an important crossroads. None the less, the heroic resistance of our armed forces inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy forces, who left behind 1,100 dead and much South African and NATO equipment.
165.	Following this defeat the Pretoria regime launched an air attack against the village of Cangamba, using a squadron of Mirage fighters and Canberra bombers, and completely destroyed the village.
166.	Faced with the escalation of the acts of aggression by the racist and fascist Pretoria regime against the People's Republic of Angola, the Angolan Government has alerted the competent international bodies to the seriousness of the situation and the unpredictable consequences. It is becoming clear to the Angolan Government that such acts of aggression constitute an integral part of collusion or a plot between certain Western Powers and the South African regime, closely associated with the puppet UNIT A bandits, aimed at the destabilization of the Angolan revolutionary process and the overthrow of the legitimate Government of the People's Republic of Angola. This would lead to the establishment of a neo- colonial regime in Angola, the annihilation of SWAPO and, consequently, the inevitable destruction of the Namibian independence process.
167.	Those plans are thus both serious and dangerous, and all this is largely due to the fact that the Angolan people, their Party and their Government have shown firm and unconditional solidarity with SWAPO and ANC in their struggle for national independence.
168.	It is appropriate to recall here that the General Assembly, in its resolution 36/121 A of 10 December 1981, declared that  the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa continues to constitute an act of aggression against the Namibian people and against the United Nations, which has direct responsibility for the Territory until independence . We should also recall that the
Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in its Political Declaration
 strongly condemned the continued military ( pupation of part of Angolan territory by the South African racist troops in violation of the national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola. The Conference considered the occupation of Angolan territory as an act of aggression against the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory and decided to increase support for and solidarity with the people and Government of Angola in order to consolidate Angola's national independence, and safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
To the extent that these two international bodies consider aggression to have been committed against them by South Africa, an adequate retort is called for. None the less, and in all honesty, it must be agreed that in spite of the legitimacy, the firmness and the scope of such positions, they have remained a dead letter as far as the overwhelming majority of the Members of the United Nations are concerned.
169.	And so it seems to us unjust and a bitter irony that because of the selfish interests of some and the passivity or unjustified indifference of others, the heroic Angolan people are being left almost alone to bear the high cost of solidarity with the Namibian people, reflected in the loss of more than 10,000 lives, thousands of mutilated and handicapped, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes. It is also reflected in $10 billion in material damages caused by the criminal aggressions carried out by the racist and Fascist Pretoria regime since 1975.
170.	None the less, the Angolan Government ventures once again to express the hope at this critical time for the People's Republic of Angola that each Member State of the United Nations will assume its responsibilities and meet its commitments, if only to maintain the credibility of this international body. Therefore, we appeal to each Member of the Organization to lend, as an emergency measure, either individually or collectively, all the material and financial assistance the People's Republic of Angola needs. We also request an intensive and permanent national and international campaign for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory. We would also ask for all forms of pressure to be exerted on the Pretoria regime as well as on its  friends and allies , including mandatory global sanctions, which have often been recommended but never enforced due to the opposition, of the Western Powers, so that its illegal occupation of Namibia may be ended. We also request that resolution 435 (1978) of the Security Council be enforced without further delay.
171.	Five years have elapsed since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978). In its resolution 532 (1983), the Council decided  to mandate the Secretary- General to undertake consultations with the parties to the proposed cease-fire, with a view to securing the speedy implementation of [Security Council] resolution 435 (1978) .
172.	In discharging his mandate, the Secretary-General made known to all of us his further report concerning the implementation of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 439 (1978) concerning the question of Namibia, which will certainly be submitted to the Security Council for its assessment in a meeting to be held shortly. 

173.	However, is it not surprising and perhaps significant that during this session of the General Assembly only one of the members of the so-called contact group- Canada—-has taken a stand on the Namibian question, especially when this was the subject of a detailed report by the Secretary-General? In this context, we take the liberty of making known to all Members an excerpt from an important statement made by President Jos6 Eduardo dos Santos, during a public meeting on the occasion of the arrival in Angola of the Secretary-General, in which he firmly reiterated, without any ambiguity whatsoever, the official position of MP LA,  the party of the workers and of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola:
 We do not agree with the idea that there should be a demand for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. They are there because their presence was requested by the sovereign Government of Angola. What is needed is a demand for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the racist South African troops occupying part of our territory in the south of Angola.
 All those who seek to establish a link or parallelism between the independence of Namibia and the presence of Cuban forces in Angola are not our friends. They are our enemies, because they want to allow the South African troops, which are already occupying part of our territory, to march on towards Luanda and to do so without meeting the slightest resistance.
 We are prepared to continue to fight and to continue to undertake diplomatic actions for a just solution to the problems in southern Africa. And once again, I reaffirm here the position of our vanguard party and of our Government:
 The first requirement is the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops occupying this territory; secondly, resolution 435 (1978) of the Security Council must be speedily implemented in order to steer Namibia to real independence; thirdly, South Africa's attacks on Angola must cease; fourthly, all logistical and military support given to the gangs of UNITA puppets terrorizing our towns must cease.
 Only if these conditions are observed will Angola be prepared to discuss with Cuba the new timetable for the gradual withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola which are guaranteeing its security. 
In this connection, it should be emphasized that this is the official position. Therefore, there is no other position, as claimed by some.
174.	We should now like to restate the position of the People's Republic of Angola on a certain number of specific political issues which are continuing to disturb international relations and to threaten world peace and security.
175.	The people of Chad are today embroiled in a bloody fratricidal war. Chad must be spared from foreign intervention so that the people can decide without constraint or hindrance how best to solve their problem in keeping with the efforts of the OAU.
176.	The solution to the conflict between POLISARIO   and the Kingdom of Morocco resides in the implementation of the resolution on the Western Sahara adopted at the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity. It is regrettable that the Kingdom of Morocco refuse   to follow the path of direct negotiation. It thus shows   n- tempt for the sovereign decision of the Heads of State and Government of Africa. It is thus responsible for the failure of the meetings of the Implementation Committee and for the consequences of the worsening of the conflict. We reiterate our militant solidarity with the heroic Saharan people and its sole and legitimate representative, POLISARIO.
177.	We reaffirm our steadfast solidarity with the valiant Palestinian people and its legitimate representative, the PLO, in the continuation of its struggle to recover its usurped land and to establish an independent State. Furthermore, we reiterate our support for the Declaration and the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine, held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983. Once again we call for the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and we commend the efforts of the Lebanese people to secure their unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
178.	After eight years of armed struggle, the people of East Timor is still continuing with determination and courage its resistance to Indonesian occupation. Given the defeats inflicted on its army as a result of the scope of the political and military action of the FRETILIN fighters, the Indonesian Government was forced to seek a meeting with the leaders of FRETILIN. That meeting took place from 20 to 23 March 1983, in the free territory of East Timor. During those talks a cease-fire was arranged in order to create a climate favourable for formal negotiations, which were to be held subsequently under the auspices of the Secretary-General and with the participation of representatives of Portugal, the former administering Power.
179.	On that occasion, the delegation of FRETILIN presented to the Indonesian delegation the following conditions: first, the unconditional withdrawal of Indonesian occupation forces from East Timor; secondly, the presence of a United Nations multinational force to replace Indonesian troops during the period of transition; thirdly, the forces of FRETILIN to remain in the regions which they controlled in order to keep the people free from any pressure; fourthly, a referendum supervised by the United Nations in order to determine the wishes of the people of East Timor.
180.	Unfortunately, it must be noted that the Indonesian Government did not respect its undertakings following the cease-fire, because it did not wish to inform the Secretary-General of the results of the talks. Instead it chose to try to go back on those talks and to reduce them to an offer of amnesty to FRETILIN. Furthermore, starting on 17 August, it launched a major military offensive in order to try to crush the heroic resistance of the people of East Timor.
181.	It is difficult to imagine that a certain number of States members of the Non-Aligned Movement, States that should be identified with the struggle of that valiant people if only out of respect for the fundamental principles of non-alignment, are in fact remaining indifferent to the genocide which is being carried out against the people of East Timor. And the United Nations cannot shirk its responsibilities with respect to that serious problem. Our solidarity is a vital duty.
182.	The central region of Latin America has experienced extremely disturbing developments as a result of threats and military intervention by the United States Government, particularly in Nicaragua and El Salvador. It is necessary to seek peace in the region through a negotiated political solution. To that end, we support the six-point position of the Government of Nicaragua as well as the efforts of the Contadora Group. In order to have peace in Central America, there must be peace 
in El Salvador and aggression against Nicaragua and EI Salvador must end. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the Revolutionary Democratic Front, the sole, legitimate representatives of the Salvadoran people.
183.	We renew our steadfast support for the Cuban revolution and we denounce acts of aggression and threats perpetrated against the Cuban people. We reiterate our feelings of solidarity with the peoples of Panama, Grenada, Chile, Uruguay, Suriname and Puerto Rico in their just struggles for their national interests, independence and territorial integrity.
184.	We reaffirm our support for finding a solution to the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela through bilateral negotiations. Furthermore, and in keeping with resolutions of the General Assembly, we express the hope that there can be an immediate beginning of negotiations between the United Kingdom and Argentina for the return to Argentina of the Malvinas, South Georgia and Sandvrk islands. At the same time, we must express our deep concern at the decision taken by the British Government to establish a military base in the Malvinas Islands, since such action would constitute a further obstacle to negotiations and a new source of tension.
185.	We also reaffirm our support for the efforts of the Indo-Chinese countries to secure peace and stability in South-East Asia, without foreign intervention, and for a continuation of constructive dialogue between the parties to the conflict. However, we consider it deplorable and almost inconceivable that the Kampuchean people should not yet be represented at the United Nations by the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. This is an injustice, which must be corrected.
186.	We reiterate our solidarity with the just cause of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in their aims of bringing about a peaceful reunification of the country without outside interference and of securing the withdrawal of United States troops from the southern part of the Korean territory.
187.	Furthermore, we reaffirm our support for the position taken and the efforts made by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in the search for a normalization, through negotiation, of the situation prevailing in and around that country.
188.	We also reiterate our complete solidarity with the people and Government of Cyprus and we support their efforts to preserve their independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-alignment.
189.	Once again we urgently appeal to the Governments of Iraq and Iran to end their war and to find a negotiated solution to the dispute between them.
190.	It is deplorable that the Angolan Government finds itself still compelled to devote the bulk of its human and material resources to the defence of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The undeclared war imposed on us by the racist and fascist South African regime must cease.
191.	The Angolan people longs for peace. It has never attacked anyone in the past and it never will. It merely wishes to live in peace and to work to build a future of progress and happiness within a just society of its own free choosing. The struggle continues, and victory is certain.

"
AGO,2010,"First, I should 
like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 
President on his election to the presidency of the 
General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to 
assure him that he can count on the support of Angola 
so that at the end of this session we will all be better 
prepared to respond to the multiple and complex 
challenges facing the international community. I also 
take this opportunity to convey, though the President, 
our most sincere gratitude to the outgoing President for 
the selfless manner in which he conducted the sixty-
fourth session. 
 In the last decade several events have profoundly 
marked the world community, including natural 
calamities and man-made disasters, which should lead 
us to consider the need to work towards a more 
cooperative and increasingly integrated world, for no 
one is immune to those phenomena. The terrorist attack 
of 2001 on the Twin Towers of New York that killed 
more than 3,000 people, the tsunami of December 2004 
in which more than 200,000 people perished, the recent 
earthquake in Haiti that caused more than 200,000 
deaths, and the series of natural disasters that have 
occurred on every continent, added to the global 
financial and economic crisis, should awaken us to the 
fact that we live in a different world that requires 
broader cooperation among nations, given that those 
phenomena are unforeseeable. 
 Therefore, in today’s world, the consequences of 
the irresponsibility of a few can have repercussions on 
the lives of us all. It is thus imperative that we pursue 
relationships that have greater balance and equality 
between large and small and rich and poor, because the 
new reality is that we are increasingly interdependent 
in a global world. 
 Angola, has always been convinced of the 
important role of the United Nations and of multilateral 
diplomacy in general, because no country can progress 
and develop unilaterally, isolated from the community 
of nations and alienated from the common problems 
affecting humanity as a whole. 
 
 
25 10-55276 
 
 In the President’s speech to the General Assembly 
on the occasion of his election (see A/64/PV.93), 
among other things he set the following topics as 
priorities for the sixty-fifth session: climate change, the 
Millennium Development Goals, food security, 
sustainable development, rebuilding and strengthening 
fragile post-conflict States, and humanitarian aid and 
disarmament. Angola is of the opinion that the 
environment and other issues he mentioned must 
remain priorities on the national and international 
agendas. They are crucial for sustainable development, 
for the growth of our economies, for the implementation 
of national strategies for combating poverty, and for 
the attainment of the Millennium Goals.  
 At the Food and Agriculture Organization’s 
Regional Conference for Africa, held recently in 
Luanda, the participants expressed their concern about 
the impact of climate change on the world food crisis 
in some regions and recommended that States make an 
extra effort to reduce its impact on agriculture. 
 Angola believes in the importance of 
multilateralism as the best form of treatment and 
resolution of the multifaceted challenges that humanity 
faces today. In that context Angola advocates a shared 
commitment to find solutions to our problems at all 
levels. 
 My country gives priority to political and 
diplomatic coordination and to strengthening 
institutional relations with the organizations of the 
United Nations system, as well as with the regional and 
subregional organizations to which it belongs, namely, 
the African Union, the Southern African Development 
Community (SADC), the Economic Community of 
Central African States (ECCAS), the International 
Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and 
the Commission on the Gulf of Guinea, the latter 
having its headquarters in Angola. 
 In the Commission on the Gulf of Guinea, 
member States cooperate with a view to managing 
potential conflicts linked to maritime borders and 
managing shared maritime resources, as well as 
coordinating policies for the prevention of maritime 
trafficking and piracy, thus providing security to a 
region that produces more than 15 per cent of the 
world’s oil. 
 With that motivation, Angola and its armed forces 
bravely participated in the liberation of southern 
Africa, having contributed to the independence of 
Namibia and to the end of apartheid in South Africa. 
With that same motivation we contributed to the 
stabilization of the Republic of Congo and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. With other 
international partners of the United Nations, we are 
participating in the training of the armed forces of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo.  
 Today the Angolan armed forces are a factor for 
stability not only for Angola, but also for the southern 
and central regions of Africa, where we are part of the 
early warning mechanisms of SADC and ECCAS. At 
present we are committed to finding solutions to the 
crisis in Guinea-Bissau, in close cooperation with other 
partners in West Africa, namely, the Economic 
Community of West African States, and in partnership 
with the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. 
 It was therefore with great amazement that we 
learned of the mention of involvement by the Angolan 
armed forces in alleged acts of human rights violations 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a report 
intended to be circulated as a document of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. We stress that that 
document was produced at the initiative of an organ of 
the United Nations Secretariat with no specific mandate 
from the Secretary-General or from Member States.  
 It is important to emphasize before the Assembly 
that Angola intervened in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo on the basis of a SADC mandate, at the 
request of the Government of the Democratic Republic. 
That intervention made it possible to stop the 
bloodbath and to save the lives of millions of people 
and lay the basis for the negotiations that culminated in 
the establishment of the transitional Government, the 
installation of the United Nations peacekeeping 
mission and the successful holding of the first 
democratic elections. It thus contributed to the 
pacification of the Great Lakes region. 
 Angola vehemently rejects the insinuation and 
considers abnormal the manner in which that so-called 
mapping exercise was conducted. We question the 
motivations behind that venture. We would like to 
reiterate that Angola and the Angolan armed forces will 
continue to act responsibly and on the basis of 
international standards and scrupulous respect for 
human rights. 
 The report of the Secretary-General to the sixty-
fifth session contains references to peace and security, 
considering them essential for development and for the 
  
 
10-55276 26 
 
promotion of and respect for human rights. Angola 
shares the concerns of the Secretary-General. Our 
experience shows that only peace, the democratic rule 
of law and respect for human rights can guarantee the 
stability necessary for sustainable development and 
improvement of the living conditions of our people. 
Angola encourages the efforts by regional organizations 
and the United Nations in conflict resolution and 
peacekeeping to ensure global security and stability. 
 A situation that is certainly of concern to all of us 
is the conflict in the Middle East. Angola recognizes 
that it has lasted a long time, with serious 
consequences for the population. Therefore we support 
the resumption of peace talks by President Barack 
Obama with a view to creating a Palestinian State that 
coexists peacefully with the State of Israel. 
 Angola is also concerned at the persistence of the 
economic, commercial and financial blockade against 
Cuba, despite successive General Assembly resolutions 
demanding its immediate removal. That unilateral 
measure, particularly its extraterritorial effects, is 
contrary to the principles and norms of international 
law and contributes to the precarious humanitarian and 
social situation of the Cuban population. From this 
rostrum we reiterate our vehement appeal for the lifting 
of a measure whose anachronistic nature has been 
restated here on numerous occasions. 
 Regarding the question of Western Sahara, 
Angola notes with concern that despite various United 
Nations resolutions and initiatives, there has not been 
the type of progress that would lead to meeting the 
aspirations of the Saharan people. We urge the 
Secretary-General to continue his efforts to attain those 
objectives. 
 Mutually beneficial cooperation, the promotion of 
peace and respect for human rights remain the major 
drivers of Angolan foreign policy, based on the 
observance of the principles of respect for sovereignty 
and territorial integrity, equality and non-interference 
in the internal affairs of other countries.  
 Internally, and as a result of experiences during 
different periods in our history, marked by three 
decades of war and political instability, Angola is now 
entering a new cycle, of which we are very proud. It is 
characterized by the adoption of a new constitution that 
marks the end of the transition period and definitively 
establishes democratic rule of law, given that elections 
will be held in June 2012. 
 We are aware that we still have a long way to go, 
especially in view of all the time lost and the delays 
accumulated in several areas. But it seems important to 
us to emphasize that the progress already achieved did 
not happen by chance. Rather, it resulted from the 
leadership efforts of the Angolan executive organs, the 
pragmatism of its policies and its commitment to better 
the human development indexes, which are reflected 
today in the improved welfare of the people. 
 After eight years of peace, Angola has 
implemented economic and social reform policies that 
have allowed for the revitalization of its economy and 
the rehabilitation of key infrastructure. Such policies 
have enabled the country’s annual growth rates to 
average double digits, with a direct impact on the 
improvement of basic indicators of the Millennium 
Development Goals.  
 Since 2002 more than 2 million children have 
been enrolled in primary education. The percentage of 
children attending school has risen sharply, to 76 per 
cent. The rate of infant and maternal mortality fell 
considerably, from 1,400 per 100,000 live births in 
2001 to 660 per 100,000 live births in 2010. Moreover, 
in order to eradicate hunger and poverty, Angola has 
adopted its National Food Security Strategy (2009-
2014) as a mechanism to increase agricultural 
production in a sustainable manner. 
 We are convinced that the international 
community is also aware of how much still has to be 
done, particularly in the areas of financing for 
development and the materialization of the 
commitments made at major international conferences 
on financing for development. 
 Finally, the reform of the Security Council, given 
its importance in the democratization of international 
relations, must remain a topic on the agenda of the 
Organization. In that connection, Angola reiterates its 
support for the African common position embodied in 
the Ezulwini Consensus. "
AGO,1980,"﻿282.	I wish to begin by conveying to the President, on behalf of the People's Republic of Angola, our warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This significant choice is undoubtedly a recognition of his distinguished personal and diplomatic qualities and merits. We wish him the greatest possible success in the exercise of his difficult task.
283.	I should also like to convey to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim our deep appreciation for his brilliant performance as President of the thirty-fourth session and reaffirm to him our pride at the farsighted and dignified manner in which he performed his task, thus enhancing the prestige not only of the United Republic of Tanzania but, above all, of the African continent.
284.	Furthermore, we wish to express to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our most profound gratitude for his tireless efforts to find the most just and appropriate solutions to the serious problems confronting the international community and pay him a tribute for his perseverance and his courage in the many contacts undertaken with those who feel directly concerned in the delicate situation prevailing in southern Africa.
285.	At this time, as the thirty-fifth session is beginning its work, the world is in an extremely complicated, delicate and dangerous situation because there is considerable aggravation of direct confrontations between numerous peoples and those who support imperialism, neo-colonialism, colonialism, expansionism, Zionism, apartheid and the exploitation of man by man.
286.	Two years ago, from this very rostrum we declared that the disturbing situation at that time might get even worse and deteriorate indefinitely as long as the Governments of certain Western Powers well known to us failed strictly to respect the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of the OAU and the principles of nonalignment; as long as they continued to foment colonial wars and to perpetrate acts of aggression of all kinds, directly or indirectly, against independent States; as long as they continued to proliferate plots against the sovereignty and security of States; as long as they continued their economic pillage of the underdeveloped countries and persisted in preventing a gradual reduction of the gap that is ceaselessly growing between the affluent or developed countries and the poor or underdeveloped countries; as long as they imposed military bases in the farthest corners of the globe, bases generally maintained against the will of the peoples concerned; as long as they persisted in thwarting the serious efforts of the socialist and progressive and democratic forces to bring about detente, general and complete disarmament and a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, including the neutron bomb; as long as they failed to comply with resolutions adopted by international bodies that clearly stipulated that it was imperative to make the Indian Ocean an effective zone of peace; as long as they continued to devote astronomical sums to the arms race instead of judiciously setting aside those same sums for the economic and social development of the developing countries; and as long as they strove to thwart the establishment of a new international economic order in spite of the principles already enunciated by the nonaligned movement.
287.	Today we note with the gravest concern that those positions remain unchanged and that consequently there must be coherent unity of action against those who alone are responsible—that is, the Western Governments and their allies—for the growing tragedy of all human beings subjected to exploitation, oppression and injustice.
288.	Thus, it is time for the millions of human beings still without freedom or the right to choose their own future to be able to avail themselves of ways and means of fighting servitude, humiliation, tyranny, poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease.
289.	It is time for all developing peoples to take resolute action in the fight against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, zionism, expansionism, apartheid and the exploitation of man by man so as to be able freely to choose their economic, political, social and cultural systems free from intimidation or pressure. It is time for them to take into their own hands their own natural resources and to exploit them for their own benefit and not for the benefit of multinational corporations. It is time for them flatly to reject all forms of subordination and dependence on any Power and all interference and all pressure, be it political, economic or military. It is time for them to demand, in combined and concerted fashion, the dismantling of foreign military bases on the territories of their countries which have been established against their will. It is time for them to make an effective contribution to the safeguarding of international peace and security and the easing of international tension. It is time for them to make a further effort to find effective means of mobilizing their human, financial, organizational and technological resources, thus laying a solid foundation for mutual economic cooperation in the raw materials field and in trade, transport, industry, agriculture, fisheries, health, insurance and so on.
290.	In a word, it is time—and perhaps all that is necessary is for all the nonaligned countries without exception decisively to put into effect the final Declaration and the Programme of Action for economic cooperation approved at the historic Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries, held at Havana, from 3 to 9 September 197924 for the serious problems besetting the world today to be properly resolved. That is our hope and our conviction.
291.	Permit us to dwell at rather greater length on the problems of detente, disarmament, the nuclear threat and the arms race, because these are the major concerns of the countries that love peace and justice. Once again we are obliged to repeat ourselves. Considerable and praiseworthy efforts have been made, particularly by the socialist countries, to bring about detente and disarmament, to stave off the nuclear threat and to halt the arms race. If detente, which is so ardently desired, is to be meaningful and effective it is indispensable for it to lead to the eliminate f all sources of tension and the halting of aggression, for interference and the political and economic exploitation of the weakest countries, as well as to the adoption of serious and concrete measures by all in the field of disarmament.
292.	In so far as concerns general and complete disarmament, it is imperative for negotiations to continue towards the establishment of treaties or conventions designed to save mankind from the disastrous consequences of an unbridled arms race as well as major or minor wars. Once and for all, all nuclear Powers in particular must undertake to embark upon the gradual destruction of their arsenals of nuclear weapons and to adhere to and respect the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
293.	We all know that the international situation is one of extreme tension. Over and above the factors I have mentioned, we must bear in mind the escalation of the cold war started by the United States Administration following the important victories won by the struggling peoples which have frustrated its shameful policy of domination and exploitation. Many threats of aggression, of military intervention, of economic sanctions were then forthcoming from the imperialist Powers.
294.	That climate of tension was to encourage a certain number of States to engage in an arms race, which is something that has always been of benefit to the Governments of imperialist Powers because of the fabulous profits they earn through their military consortia; and, apart from that, it served certain electoral interests, particularly in the United States of America.
295.	Within the same context, certain representatives of Western Powers have frequently donned the mantle of champions of human rights, but that has always been a matter of opportunism, transient interests or the needs of their constituents.
296.	If, from the point of view of credibility, the words they have uttered reflect a coherent attitude of action and determination on the part of their Governments to defend human rights, we would venture formally to call upon them to render every kind of assistance to the Namibian peoples and to the South Africans, the Sahraoui, the Palestinians, the Mauberes of East Timor, the Chileans, the Uruguayans, the Salvadorians, the Kampucheans and the Puerto Ricans, as well as all other fighting against tyranny, oppression, exploitation, social injustice and racial discrimination; and we would call upon them at the same time to denounce the regimes that are oppressing those peoples; to lift the economic blockade imposed upon Cuba and denounce the pressure exerted on and the threats uttered against the Cuban revolution; to halt all economic and military support for dictatorial racist and Fascist regimes; and to reduce, considerably and steadily, their military budgets and thus to help the peoples of the underdeveloped countries to combat famine, poverty, disease, illiteracy, unemployment and so on.
297.	In reviewing the situation that prevails in the African continent, we note with regret that one of the fundamental objectives of the OAU has not yet been achieved—the total liberation of Africa.
298.	Who is to blame for this? Not the OAU. Once again, the responsibility lies with the imperialist Powers, inasmuch as they are pursuing their aggressive policy to perpetuate or extend their domination and exploitation of the African nations and to destabilize States that oppose their plans. In the context of southern Africa, one people, that of Zimbabwe, has also just seized its independence after a fierce armed struggle. Today, Zimbabwe is a sovereign State, a member of the OAU, of the United Nations and of the nonaligned movement. The People's Republic of Angola rejoices at this happy event and reiterates its congratulations to the people and leaders of Zimbabwe, who have fought so valiantly and have thwarted all manoeuvres designed to set up a puppet regime.
299.	In the same region another people, that of Namibia, is awaiting the historic moment when it will regain its inalienable right to freedom and independence within the territorial integrity of its own country.
300.	During the last 20 years, numerous relevant resolutions have been adopted by various international bodies recognizing, on the one hand, the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence and, on the other hand, denouncing or condemning the illegal occupation of Namibia by the criminal South African regime, with its shameful system of apartheid, which is an intolerable and flagrant violation of human rights and the rights of peoples, its unacceptable arrogance and scorn for the international community and its organizations, and the lavish support afforded by certain Western Powers.
301.	Ever since the establishment of the United Nations Council for Namibia in May 1967 as the legal Administering Authority of Namibia until its independence and as the decision-making organ of the United Nations for that Territory, the Pretoria regime and its accomplices have striven to obstruct the fulfilment of the Council's mandate and have arranged a series of manoeuvres designed to delay for as long as possible the inevitable independence of Namibia. Throughout all these years, the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], it sole and legitimate representative, has been carrying on an armed struggle for national liberation and has achieved considerable success.
302.	What is the situation today? If, on the one hand, the United Nations, and particularly its Secretary General, the OAU, and particularly the frontline countries and the nonaligned countries, as international organizations, have bent every effort to finding a just solution to the Namibian problem, on the other hand, the racist and Fascist Pretoria regime, which not only enjoys the support of certain Western Powers and Israel in the economic, military and nuclear fields, but which also, and consequently, takes advantage of their lack of determination, their selfishness and their hypocrisy, has continued insolently to defy the international community, to be intolerably rude and arrogant towards the Secretary General of the United Nations, to intensify its criminal aggression against countries bordering on Namibia, in particular the People's Republic of Angola, and to set up a so-called Ministerial Council, loyal to it, in order to keep SWAPO out of the process of independence.
303.	Since the efforts of all of us seem to be directed more clearly towards the search for a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question under the auspices of the United Nations, we must necessarily and unambiguously give all the necessary support to the Secretary General so that he may have every possibility of ensuring the earliest possible implementation of the plan established by the United Nations in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).
304.	However, if the South African regime, by its stubbornness, frustrates the solution of the Namibian question by means of negotiations, that will mean the choice of war, and as a consequence that regime and certain Western Powers will bear the very heavy responsibility for the disastrous consequences of such a choice. Whatever the circumstances, our support for SWAPO will be unswerving.
305.	Allow me to remind this Assembly that the material damage to the People's Republic of Angola caused by the invasion by South African armed forces in 1975 and 1976 has been evaluated at $6.7 billion, as was pointed out by the present Head of State of Angola in his first address at this rostrum in December 1976, speaking as the Minister for Foreign Affairs. On that occasion, he proposed for the consideration of the United Nations General Assembly the creation of an international fund for national reconstruction of some $300 million, but this was not given the slightest attention by the international community. I would also venture to add that the material damage from 1978 to the present day has been estimated to amount to $200 million. With rare exceptions, international solidarity in our regard has amounted to only indifference or inaction.
306.	The People's Republic of Angola reaffirms its determination to cooperate closely with the United Nations Secretary General to ensure that the parties to the conflict, namely, the South African regime and SWAPO, resolutely undertake to seek a negotiated solution to the Namibian question.
307.	The firm and hard line we have taken may seem surprising, but it is difficult, if not impossible, for us to translate into diplomatic language the feelings of genuine revulsion of the heroic people of Angola in the face of the enormous sacrifices it has already made and the extremely high price it is still paying, almost alone, in thousands of human lives lost and in material damage, in order to fulfil its international duty and to comply with the relevant resolutions of international bodies with regard to Namibia, that the people of Namibia may also become free and independent.
308.	In South Africa, as everyone knows, the internal situation is gradually getting worse, thanks to the persistent fight being waged by the numerous and valiant militants of the African National Congress against the last bastion of imperialism in the African continent. At the same time, the internal contradictions of the apartheid regime are becoming aggravated because of this very struggle for national liberation. What we need then is concrete and growing solidarity with the valiant fighters of the African National Congress.
309.	In Western Sahara, the heroic Sahraoui people under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front, its sole and lawful representative is continuing its relentless struggle against Moroccan occupation to recover its inalienable right to self-determination, independence and national sovereignty. The recognition of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic by a considerable number of countries, especially African countries, makes it abundantly clear that final victory is near.
310.	Thus it is with justified hope that we await, within the framework of the OAU and in cooperation with the United Nations, through the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State and Government on Western Sahara, the necessary political solution following the recent deliberations held by that Committee, which met at Freetown from 9 to 12 September this year . The Sahraoui people will triumph. The considerable success won both in the military field and in the diplomatic field justifies this assurance of ours.
311.	We should not like to leave the African continent without referring, however briefly, to the tragedy which has afflicted the people of Chad as a consequence of numerous instances of foreign intervention. We appeal to the international community to provide urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to the Government of National Union, either directly or through the OAU, and also to neighbouring countries which have given shelter to thousands of refugees, thus enabling the people of Chad themselves to solve their own problems.
312.	In the Asian and Latin American continents, we find a proliferation of sources of tension fomented essentially by North American imperialism.
313.	With regard to the development of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, it is our belief that the concrete proposals contained in the statement of its Government made on 15 May 1980 provide a valid means of seeking the necessary solution, that is to say a negotiated political solution. The taking into account of these points by the neighbouring countries, namely, Pakistan and Iran, pursuant to the principle of the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, would make it possible to normalize relations among the three nonaligned countries and to promote a climate of harmony and stability in the area.
314.	For its part, the valiant people of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has since last year scored some very important and indisputable successes in the consolidation of its revolutionary process and control over its territory, as well as in the fields of agriculture, education and health care. The circulation of the new national currency is also a significant step for the economy of the country. The gradual recovery from the shock caused to the Kampuchean people by the murder of 3 million of its people, its compatriots, committed by the criminal regime that was overthrown, deserves all our admiration, which we wish to convey to the leaders of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.
315.	It is, however, regrettable and unthinkable that the legitimate representatives of the Kampuchean people should still not be occupying their proper place in all international bodies and that in the meantime we, the nonaligned countries, have not been able to gain the endorsement at the United Nations of the decision taken at Havana at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries, namely, to keep the seat empty until it has been determined to which of the two parties that empty seat belongs. Sooner or later, justice will be done.
316.	In spite of the persistent efforts of the heroic Korean people to reunify their country by peaceful means and without any outside interference in their internal affairs, it is with indignation that we note the continuation of imperialist manoeuvring aimed at establishing two Koreas. We demand the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in the southern part of Korea, the replacement of the Armistice Agreement  by a long-term peace agreement and the dismantling of the military bases that exist there so as to enable the whole Korean people to bring to fruition the three principles essential to their future: independence, peaceful reunification and broad national unity.
317.	With regard to the situation prevailing in East Timor, it is deplorable and unacceptable that foreign troops belonging to a member of the nonaligned movement should have continued to occupy part of the territory—the capital, as a matter of fact—of the Democratic Republic of East Timor ever since the proclamation of its independence in 1975 following the withdrawal of the former administering Power, without the legal and political status of the territory having been established. For five years the people of East Timor, under the leadership of their lawful representative, FRETILIN have been waging an armed struggle to recover national sovereignty and territorial integrity, although in extremely difficult circumstances marked by a lack of external logistic bases, a lack of replacements of heavy weaponry and modern antiaircraft weapons, a lack of financial assistance and the incomprehensible inaction of the progressive community.
318.	In order to prove, should proof be needed, the gradual development of the armed struggle of the Maubere people against the Indonesian military occupation, it is sufficient to refer, by way of example, to a large-scale attack carried out by 300 FRETILIN fighters on the night of 10 to 11 June 1980 at Dili, the capital of the country. In six hours of fighting, the television station was damaged and two military barracks were taken by storm and occupied for several hours. Three days later, the Indonesian leaders landed at Dili 40 tanks and a large contingent of marines and commandos.
319.	East Timor is obviously a problem of decolonization. Like the Palestinian and Namibian peoples, the Maubere people are still prevented from exercising their right to independence because of Indonesian military occupation, in spite of the resolutions adopted by organs of the United Nations and by the nonaligned movement.
320.	A few days ago the Portuguese Government decided to shoulder once again its obligations and responsibilities with regard to East Timor, and it formally reaffirmed the right of the people of that country to self-determination. We would venture to hope that the Portuguese Government will undertake effectively and with determination and courage to make every effort to put an end to the Indonesian military occupation and to ensure the transfer of power to the people of the Democratic Republic of East Timor. There is no other way. It is now the duty of all countries and all international organizations which identify with the struggle of peoples to render every kind of assistance to the people of East Timor.
321.	In the Middle East, the data of the problem remain unchanged, although the consequences are becoming ever more serious for the Arab peoples. As long as the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine to recover its country, usurped by Israel, and to establish an independent State are not duly recognized by everyone, as long as Israel does not withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories, as long as it continues its criminal raids and its acts of aggression against Lebanon, as long as it continues to establish settlements in the occupied Palestinian or Arab territories, as long as the United States of America in particular continues to support Israel in all possible ways in its annexationist ambitions, as long as the city of Jerusalem is not restored in its entirety to the Arab nation, as long as the so-called Camp David accords and the Egypt Israel peace Treaty represent a partial and separate commitment which fails to take into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and is consequently a flagrant violation of the resolutions adopted by various international bodies, there will never be a just and lasting peace. However, we are convinced that the solution of the Palestinian question and of the Middle East problem lies fundamentally in the hands of the Arab countries if they jointly make up their minds to make use of all the advantages at their disposal against all those who support Israel.
322.	We reaffirm our unswerving support for the Palestinian people and its sole legitimate representative, the PLO.
323.	We should also like to take this opportunity to express our unswerving support for the people and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus in their just struggle to safeguard their independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and nonalignment.
324.	In Latin America, substantial and positive changes have taken place thanks to the valiant struggle being waged by its peoples. The Cuban revolution has been firmly consolidated and constitutes an undeniable source of inspiration for all struggling peoples, in spite of the economic blockade imposed by the American imperialists and the unjustifiable maintenance of the naval base at Guantanamo. It is time to put an end to these constant threats and acts of aggression against Cuba.
325.	The revolutionary process in Nicaragua is proceeding towards the building of a future in keeping with the interests of the Nicaraguan people and we rejoice at their brilliant successes in national reconstruction.
326.	We warmly welcome the victories won by the people of San Salvador and by its vanguard organization, the Revolutionary Democratic Front, as well as those of the Puerto Rican and Chilean peoples in their struggle against imperialism and its agents so that power may be transferred to those peoples and they may freely choose their own future. We denounce vigorously the manoeuvres of North American imperialism aimed at destabilizing regimes in power, particularly in Jamaica, Grenada, Guyana and Panama, and we reaffirm our militant solidarity with them in their struggle against these neo-colonialist designs.
327.	What else remains to be said, without repeating ourselves, about the grave economic crisis of the capitalist system or the urgent need to establish a new international economic order?
328.	We venture to deplore the fact that, following the awakening of Africa to economic questions which marked the second extraordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held at Lagos on 28 and 29 April 1980, the Plan of Action adopted  there was not accorded the slightest consideration by the delegations—even the African delegations—which participated in the eleventh special session of the General Assembly, on global economic questions, held recently at United Nations Headquarters.
329.	Nevertheless, we hope that in the future we shall be better able to defend the economic interests of the African peoples or help them prevail.
330.	The Angolan people is preparing enthusiastically for the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola.
331.	During those five years, considerable results have been achieved in the consolidation of the Angolan revolutionary process, in the establishment of Party structures over the whole of the country, in the strengthening of national unity and defence and in laying the foundations of a socialist society. At present, the Angolan people, faithful to the teachings of the immortal guide of the Angolan revolution and founder of the nation and of the MPLA  Workers' Party, the late President Agostinho Neto, and under the farsighted leadership of Comrade Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, President of the MPL A Workers' Party, President of the Republic and Commander-in-chief of the armed forces, are totally involved in the preparation of the first special Party congress and in the electoral process in all the provinces of future members of the People's Assembly, which is an emanation of the power of the people which will come into being shortly.
332.	At the same time, considerable efforts have been made in the fields of education, agriculture, industry, health, fisheries, transport and construction, which hold considerable promise for the economic and social development of the People's Republic of Angola.
333.	What we hope for is to be left in peace, with respect for our own wishes, so that we may better meet the aspirations of the Angolan people and thus make a valuable contribution to world peace and security.
334.	The struggle continues. Victory is certain.
"
AGO,2013,"On behalf of 
the President of the Republic of Angola, His Excellency 
Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos, whom I have the honour to 
represent before the Assembly, allow me to congratulate 
Ambassador John William Ashe on his election to the 
presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth 
session and to assure him of my country’s support in 
the fulfilment of that important and noble mission. 
I would also like to express our gratitude to His 
Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for the effective manner 
in which he conducted the work of the previous session, 
and we salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his 
continued dedication to the cause of our Organization.

This session of the General Assembly is taking 
place in a complex international climate, one where the 
intervention of the international community is needed 
to provide lasting solutions to conflicts that constitute 
serious threats to international peace and security. 
The prevalence of armed conflicts and their impact 
on populations, terrorism, organized crime and drug 
trafficking, maritime piracy, environmental crimes 
and looting of resources, as well as extreme poverty, 
deprivation and hunger are issues that require priority 
attention from our Organization. Angola reiterates 
the importance of the role of the United Nations as a 
driving force behind global efforts to maintain peace, 
stability and economic and social development, and 
it is therefore important to strengthen its capacity for 
conflict prevention and crisis management.

My country will continue to contribute actively 
in peacekeeping efforts, assuming responsibilities 
at the international level, in particular with regard to 
Africa, as well as in the regional framework and the 
economic and political groups it is a part of, including 
the Southern African Development Community, the 
Economic Community of Central African States, the 
Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the 
International Conference on the Great Lakes Region 
and the Gulf of Guinea Commission.

In that context, the Peace, Security and Cooperation 
Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and the Region, signed in February in Addis Ababa, is 
both the most appropriate mechanism for the peaceful 
resolution of the conflict in the eastern Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and the best guarantee for 
regional stability and for safeguarding the peace, 
security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. We reiterate our 
call to the signatories to respect their commitments, and 
we condemn the threats that negative forces continue to 
pose to civilian populations, particularly in the city of 
Goma and its surrounding area.

In the context of global efforts to maintain 
international peace and security, we reiterate the 
importance of revitalizing the United Nations system, 
particularly through reform of the Security Council, 
which should adapt to the realities of today’s world by 
increasing the number of its permanent members so as 
to fairly represent every region.

We express our deep concern about the escalation 
of violence in Egypt and add our voice to the call to the 
transitional authorities to act with moderation. We urge 
the African Union and the international community to 
continue to work towards a solution to the crisis in that 
country.

The conflict in Syria poses a risk to international 
peace and security, and the violence is seriously 
worsening the humanitarian situation in the region. 
We call on the international community to act urgently 
in order to arrive at a peaceful solution to the conflict 
through the mediation of the United Nations and the 
Arab League, and we urge respect for the human rights 
of civilians.

The Israeli-Palestine conflict is one of the oldest on 
our planet and one that still confounds the international 
community. Angola supports the mediation efforts 
undertaken by United States Secretary of State John 
Kerry, and hopes for the resumption of dialogue and 
the conclusion of an agreement between Palestine and 
Israel that can convert the deadlock into lasting peace 
and the establishment of an independent Palestinian 
State within the 1967 borders, living side by side with 
the State of Israel in security.

We note with concern the poor progress being 
made in resolving the question of Western Sahara, 
and we urge the parties to continue negotiations under 
the auspices of the United Nations, so that the people 
of Western Sahara can exercise their right to self-
determination.

Angola welcomes the normalization of the legal 
and constitutional framework of various African 
countries that, after tumultuous periods of instability, 



have successfully held free and fair elections and are 
now making strides towards building democratic 
States, establishing the rule of law and promoting 
economic and social development. In that connection, 
we welcome the democratic election of President 
Ibrahim Keita in Mali and express our solidarity with 
the process of reconciliation and reconstruction of the 
country. We also congratulate those countries that have 
shown positive developments and that despite unstable 
situations are working to implement agreements aimed 
at resolving crises and normalizing their constitutional 
frameworks. They include Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, 
Somalia, the Sudan and South Sudan. We call for the 
entire international community to support the efforts 
those countries are making to achieve peace and 
stability.

Six years after the onset of the international 
financial crisis, with its grave repercussions for the 
world economy, many countries are experiencing serious 
difficulties in financing programmes for economic 
growth and mobilizing resources for development 
aimed at improving living conditions and meeting the 
Millennium Development Goals. That situation is even 
more problematic for developing countries, particularly 
in Africa, where armed conflict and poverty frequently 
coincide.

In that context, the Angolan Government believes 
that it is essential that we consider “The post-2015 
development agenda: setting the stage”, the theme of 
this session of the General Assembly, in the hope that 
it will contribute effectively to the economic and social 
development of developing countries. The Angolan 
Government is of the view that during this session the 
Assembly should consider holding regional meetings 
based on the report of the High-level Panel on the Post-
2015 Development Agenda, A New Global Partnership: 
Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through 
Sustainable Development, in which various leaders 
could define their positions on the post-2015 agenda 
from a regional perspective, and which could be 
followed by another meeting at the global level. In that 
regard, the Government of Angola reiterates its support 
for initiatives aimed at liberalizing international trade 
so as to promote fair and balanced competition, and 
we hope that the ninth World Trade Organization 
Ministerial Conference, scheduled to take place in Bali 
in December, will lead to the best results.

Environmental challenges persist. By renewing the 
commitments to sustainable development contained 
in Agenda 21, the United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development provided a sound basis 
for policy-making at the national and international 
levels and for ensuring the social, economic and 
environmental welfare of our peoples. To that end, we 
reiterate that it is essential to take appropriate measures 
to strengthen international support for actions in support 
of sustainable development, as well as to increase 
the financial resources of the United Nations budget 
through contributions so as to enable the Organization 
to fulfil its mandate efficiently and make sustainable 
development a reality.

On another topic, the embargo against Cuba violates 
the rules of international law and has for decades been 
a major impediment to the development of that country 
and to the improvement of the living conditions of the 
Cuban people. Angola reiterates its position of principle 
that, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the 
United Nations, the embargo should be brought to an 
end.

Angola reiterates its belief in mutual respect 
and mutual benefit, good neighbourliness and the 
strengthening of regional economic integration. Angola 
will continue to respect all international commitments 
and treaties to which it is a party. We respect and 
implement the principles of the Charter of the United 
Nations and the Constitutional Act of the African Union, 
and we establish relations based on the principles of 
self-determination, the peaceful settlement of disputes 
and respect for human rights.

Currently, Angola is experiencing a period of 
consolidation in its democratic institutions and the 
rule of law. There has also been a dynamic process 
of reconstruction and development marked by the 
consolidation of macroeconomic stability through the 
implementation of a national policy and strategy for the 
promotion of economic diversification contained in our 
economic and social development plan for the period 
2013-2017.

By agreeing to join the programme of countries 
eligible to graduate from the least developed country 
category, Angola reaffirms its priority to implement a 
programme of diversification of its domestic production 
aimed at achieving balanced growth in various sectors, 
expanding employment opportunities and decreasing 
its dependence on imports of consumer products and its 
high dependence on oil sector exports.



Despite progress made in the past decade and the 
fact that the Angolan economy is on the right path, much 
remains to be done in order to fulfil the Millennium 
Development Goals. Aware of that challenge, the 
Government continues to develop programmes aimed 
at reducing social inequality, while pursuing the fight 
against hunger and poverty as two crucial elements 
for building a prosperous society and attaining social 
justice. Furthermore, rehabilitating and upgrading the 
main productive and social infrastructure, including 
the reconstruction of roads and railways, electricity and 
water supply and distribution systems, and sanitation 
and telecommunication networks, continue to be a 
challenge for the Government in its quest to improve 
the well-being of the population and attain sustainable 
development in Angola.

I would like to conclude by referring to an issue 
of particular importance for the Government of my 
country. The Republic of Angola is a candidate for 
non-permanent-member status in the Security Council, 
with elections to be held at the sixty-ninth session of 
the General Assembly. We hope we can count on the 
support of all the States that make up the Assembly.

I will finish by expressing my country’s 
unconditional support for the initiatives of the United 
Nations aimed at building a better world for all, based 
on justice and freedom, free from all threats that 
endanger international peace and security.
"
AGO,1994,"Please allow me
to begin by congratulating Mr. Amara-Essy, on behalf of
the Government of the Republic of Angola, on my own
behalf and on behalf of my delegation, on his election to
the presidency of this forty-ninth session of the United
Nations General Assembly. We are fully convinced that his
diplomatic experience and dedication to the noble ideals of
our Organization will ensure the success of the Assembly’s
proceedings at this session. I wish to assure him of my
delegation’s full cooperation.
I should also like to express our appreciation to your
predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally,
for his proven dedication and skill in conducting the
activities of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session.
I also wish to express the profound gratitude of the
people and Government of the Republic of Angola to the
Secretary-General for his skill, energy and tenacity, and for
all his efforts in the search for solutions to the innumerable
and serious problems afflicting the peoples of our planet.
The history we are witnessing today clearly shows a
flagrant betrayal of many peoples’ expectations of a better
world following the end of the cold war. We had all hoped
for, and anticipated, life in a better world of peace and
prosperity. Instead, we are witnessing the proliferation of
internal conflicts, with such tragic consequences, and we
see no visible signs of any immediate satisfactory and
lasting solutions, despite the efforts of this Organization.
With the end of the cold war and ideological
confrontation, the African continent has witnessed during
the past five years a vast expansion of democracy, which
has contributed to the revival of hope for the prosperity and
well-being of the African peoples, still suffering the
economic backwardness bequeathed by colonialism.
However, Africa continues to be the continent most
affected by the proliferation of war and political instability.
It is sufficient to mention as examples the conflicts in
Rwanda, Somalia, Liberia, Burundi and my own country.
Similar problems are occurring in many other parts
of the world, which indicates the need for an immediate
intensification of efforts by the international community,
and in particular for increased participation by the United
Nations, to find a negotiated, just and acceptable formula
to protect the legitimate interests of peoples.
The United Nations must define universal guidelines
to prevent the application of differing criteria to the
solution of various conflicts. In other words, in order to
maintain the credibility of our Organization, all crises and
conflicts must be given fair and equal treatment. This
underlines the urgent need to restructure United Nations
procedures in order to make the existing mechanisms for
the prevention and management of conflicts compatible
with the realities of our time.
With respect to human rights, the United Nations
should continue to play an active role in order to prevent
their continuing to be jeopardized. The recent
establishment of the post of High Commissioner for
human rights by the General Assembly was an important
step forward in this sense.
The Republic of Angola reaffirms that human rights
and fundamental freedoms are universal, and that their
promotion and protection should be ensured on the basis
of equality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.
The human rights issue cannot and should not be used as
a political weapon or a pretext for interference in the
internal affairs of States.
Angola follows with interest and satisfaction the
positive developments taking place in some regions of the
world, where solutions are being found to conflicts that
had seemed endless. In the Middle East, for example, the
determination of the Palestinian people and the political
courage of the present Government of Israel have
contributed to the climate of reduced tension that led to
the historic agreement, signed in Washington, for the
autonomy of Gaza and Jericho - territories illegally
occupied in the past.
We appeal to the international community to make
every effort to ensure strict compliance with the
agreement, and success for it, by providing all possible
help to the Palestinian people for the reconstruction and
socio-economic development of the embryonic Palestinian
State.
42


It would not be immoderate to once again hail the
courage and determination demonstrated by President
Yasser Arafat and by Mr. Shimon Peres.
We encourage the Government of Israel to continue
the contacts already initiated with the countries of the
region with a view to achieving peace and harmony in the
area.
In southern Africa, we laud the courage and
determination of the people of South Africa, which led to
the fall of the inhuman and anachronistic apartheid regime.
Today we rejoice to see the people of South Africa free at
last. We again greet the new South Africa, led by
President Mandela, this different South Africa, which
emerged from a democratic election, whose results were
accepted by all the political forces in the country.
We warmly congratulate the new South African
authorities and welcome them to our Organization. We
also pay tribute to the peoples of southern Africa, who
made so many sacrifices before toppling the dreadful
apartheid regime.
Angola, which was the main victim of innumerable
attacks, suffering enormous loss of human life and
destruction of social and economic infrastructures, because
of the support we gave to the brotherly people of South
Africa, has reason to ask here and now whether the
resolutions of this Assembly and of the Security Council
regarding compensation to my country will now be
implemented.
In Mozambique, we welcome and encourage the
Government’s commitment to organize democratic
elections, and we urge RENAMO and other political forces
to respond with an equal commitment to the success of the
process, leading to lasting peace in that country. However,
the United Nations, in particular, and the international
community, in general, have an important role to play in
ensuring the attainment of the main objectives: peace,
democracy and prosperity.
In Liberia, we are encouraged by the positive
developments and by the dialogue that is taking place
between the parties involved. Angola encourages the
continuation of such dialogue and urges the parties to truly
commit themselves to the search for a lasting peace.
With regard to Western Sahara, Angola urges the
parties involved to apply the United Nations peace plan
strictly and to adhere scrupulously to the mechanisms
established for that purpose, which have the full support
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and we
encourage the parties to enter into direct dialogue to
facilitate progress.
In Rwanda, the easing of political and military
upheavals notwithstanding, a precarious socio-
humanitarian situation prevails. Angola expresses its
solidarity with the brotherly people of Rwanda. We
consider that the international community should continue
to play an important role in solving the crisis in Rwanda
and in maintaining the peace and tranquillity of its
peoples.
In Somalia, in spite of the commitment demonstrated
by the international community, we do not foresee an end
to the armed conflict in the near future, because of the
lack of consensus between the parties involved. Angola
considers that our Organization should continue to assume
its responsibility in the maintenance of world peace and
security, which are threatened in that part of Africa, and
we appeal to the common sense of the parties to
cooperate with the United Nations in the efforts to
re-establish peace in that country.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, in spite of the enormous
efforts by the international community to restore peace,
profound differences still remain, and this contributes to
the continuation of the conflict. We therefore urge the
parties and the international community to continue their
efforts to find a lasting solution that is acceptable to the
parties involved. Finally, we salute the Government of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for its efforts to that
end.
With regard to the Korean peninsula, Angola
encourages the efforts towards reunification and salutes
the positive signs registered in the dialogue between the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United
States of America.
Angola is following with concern the situation in
East Timor. The international community has witnessed
the serious and persistent violations of human-rights to
which the suffering people of East Timor have been
subjected. Angola considers that there is a fundamental
problem to be resolved first. Here, I refer to
decolonization and to respect for the rights of the peoples
of this territory - mainly, their right to self-determination.
We therefore urge the Government of Indonesia to
recognize the legitimate right of the people of East Timor
to self-determination and independence and to cooperate
43


with Portugal, as the administering Power, and with the
United Nations towards fulfilment of the wishes of the
Maubere people.
The current situation in Cuba, following the tightening
of the economic embargo, should be one of the main
concerns at this session of the General Assembly, as its
direct victims are the populations of island.
The General Assembly’s adoption of resolutions 47/19
and 48/16 clearly demonstrates that the economic,
commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is
contrary to the principles of international law and the
Charter of the United Nations. For this reason, and in
particular because of the extraterritorial application of that
unilateral measure, Angola condemns it.
As we add our voice to those of all who seek an end
to the embargo imposed against Cuba we are convinced that
only through dialogue - never by adopting drastic and
inhuman measures such as I have mentioned - can disputes
be resolved. We therefore encourage the continuance of
dialogue between the two countries towards the resolution
of their differences within the framework of the Charter of
the United Nations.
The international strategy for development for the
years 1991-2000, which was adopted in December 1991,
brought hope to the international community, which has
regarded the effective implementation of this new strategy
as the solution to the socio-economic problems of our
planet. Today, three years having elapsed, a certain
scepticism is shaking our initial convictions.
The Republic of Angola considers that the role played
by the international economic institutions - bodies such as
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,
the World Trade Organization and the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade - is of vital importance. In the fight
against trade barriers, these bodies create enormous
opportunities for developing countries to participate in the
development of the world market. The heavy and painful
burden of external debt dating back to 1982 leads us to
believe that the efforts of all are necessary if we are to find
medium- and long-term solutions.
Equally, special attention must be given to the issues
of sustainable development. This necessarily implies
implementation of the objectives of the Rio summit and the
honouring of commitments assumed thereafter by the
industrialized countries.
The data included in the reports presented to the
Cairo Conference on Population and Development
demonstrate that the social situation throughout the world
is assuming almost alarming proportions. The fact that
the world’s population is now 5.5 billion and that the
majority of these people live in absolute poverty
convinces us of the urgent need to adopt, during the
forthcoming World Summit for Social Development, a
concerted plan of action calling for measures to counter
the increasing deterioration in their social condition. We
therefore reiterate our firm belief in the legitimacy of the
goals set out in the document entitled ""African Common
Position on Human and Social Development in Africa"".
Having made a few comments on the main problems
that affect all of us in one way or another, I should like
to make a brief reference to the situation in my country.
Representatives will probably recall that, following
UNITA’s rejection of the results of the democratic
elections in 1992, which the international community
monitored and judged to have been free and fair, UNITA
resorted to war, with the objective of taking power by
force of arms, contrary to the spirit of the Bicesse
Accord, of which this Organization is a signatory and
which served as the basis for the electoral process.
The situation created by the resumption of war
rapidly degenerated into a real catastrophe, jeopardizing
the country’s territorial integrity and forcing the legitimate
government to take defensive measures to prevent the
realization of UNITA’s intentions.
In spite all the efforts of the Angolan Government
and of the international community, and as a result of this
war, imposed on the people of Angola by the militaristic
wing of Mr. Savimbi’s UNITA, Angola faces a rather
sombre future - one dangerously similar to those of the
countries that I have already mentioned.
The present situation in my country is characterized
by the extreme poverty of the people, who, having fled
the war zones in order to save their lives, have become
refugees in their own land.
In Angola there are currently 3.75 million displaced
persons, more than 500,000 mutilated people and
thousands of orphaned children and abandoned elderly
folk. In addition, almost of the country’s all economic
infrastructures have been destroyed. In some areas
controlled by the Government, people and goods cannot
always circulate freely, owing to mines and to the acts of
44


terrorism and banditry perpetrated by UNITA’s military
wing.
The difficult situation that I have just described must
continue to command the attention of the international
community if the people and the legitimate Government are
to be helped to re-establish peace throughout the country.
As those present in this Hall know, on 15 November
last, following the failure of our attempts to establish a
dialogue, from Namibia to Addis Ababa and Abidjan, the
Government of Angola initiated the negotiations of Lusaka.
These were mediated by the United Nations and were
observed by Portugal, Russia and the United States of
America, whose endeavour has contributed to the consensus
in the negotiators’ position.
It is important that we should once again express our
sincere gratitude to the Government of His Excellency
President Chiluba for his generosity and patience in
receiving the Angolan people in his country and for his
positive action, albeit discreet and unofficial. We also
reiterate our appreciation of the important role played by
the troika of observers - Portugal, Russia and the United
States of America - and for the committed way in which
the Secretary-General’s special representative, Mr. Allioune
Beye, has conducted the negotiations in Lusaka. Mr.
Beye’s knowledge of the Angolan situation is our guarantee
of a rapid conclusion to the talks. The people of Angola
and the international community expressed their satisfaction
at the fact that UNITA has finally accepted the mediators’
package of proposals, for this constitutes an important step
towards peace and national reconciliation.
It is none the less true that UNITA accepted this
package of proposals by the mediators only because of
pressure from the international community and, first and
foremost, from the Security Council through its numerous
resolutions, in particular resolutions 864 (1993) and
932 (1994), which advocated the imposition of sanctions
against UNITA if its leadership did not demonstrate good
faith about the conclusion of an agreement; and, also
because on the military front there had been a clear reversal
of the situation. Today the Government already controls
more than 75 per cent of the territory and 90 per cent of
the population.
We are convinced that if this pressure is maintained
UNITA, which knows only the language of the force of
weapons, might engage in a constructive and honest
dialogue. In this context we once again urge the
international community to continue exercising its various
forms of pressure on UNITA’s militaristic wing so that an
agreement is reached in Lusaka to put a definitive end to
the war and to restore peace and harmony among the
Angolan people.
We are not aiming at a military victory. We want
an agreement that can bring lasting peace and pave the
way to national reconciliation. Our insistence on pressure
is based on our desire that the relative progress made in
Lusaka be irreversible, as it is only a step along the
difficult path to peace and its consolidation, to the
promotion of the country’s unity and national
reconciliation, and to the defence of legality and
democracy.
Therefore, the international community, and the
Security Council in particular, must be prepared to act
immediately as soon as an agreement is reached in
Lusaka in order to avoid any pretexts for non-compliance.
There must not be a substantial interval between the
signing of the agreement in Lusaka and the
re-establishment of the cease-fire, on the one hand, and
the beginning of the implementation of the Lusaka
agreement, or understandings on the other; this will avoid
violations. In this context it is necessary to anticipate the
sending of the component of the United Nations Angola
Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) immediately after
the signing of the agreement.
Please allow me to reiterate before this Assembly
that it is the firm commitment of the Government of the
Republic of Angola not to spare any effort in the search
for a negotiated solution to the crisis in Angola and that
it is not our intention to destroy UNITA militarily.
Contrary to information which has been circulated
recently accusing the Government of launching a military
offensive against UNITA, we have to say that the truth is
completely different. The Government is engaged in
stopping the UNITA military offensive, with the aim of
halting the kind of events that occurred before the signing
of the Bicesse Accords, in order to ensure that a military
advantage not be obtained while the Lusaka Accord was
being signed. We should not enable UNITA to obstruct
the full implementation of the Accord. We want UNITA
to become a political party, to be prepared to live in
democracy and to respect the existing constitution, which
is the result of a difficult national consensus which
UNITA itself joined in and which it amended before it
was approved by the Parliament.
45


Finally, we would like to send a strong appeal to the
international community to increase humanitarian assistance
to the needy people. The Government’s scarce resources
are insufficient to meet the dramatic socio-humanitarian
situation of the people being rescued from the captivity of
UNITA.
Members have had the opportunity to see on
television the real situation in Kuito and elsewhere. The
Government of Angola has always been committed to
delivering humanitarian assistance to all the needy
regardless of where they may be, and requests that
pressure be exerted on UNITA not to hamper the efforts
to distribute relief supplies to the population and the work
of non-governmental organizations and United Nations
agencies which with great sacrifice are involved in
humanitarian assistance to Angola.
I reiterate our best wishes for the success of this
forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.
"
AGO,2007,"At the outset, 
I would like to salute the international community, 
legitimately represented here today. I would also like 
to take this opportunity to personally congratulate 
Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his election to the post of 
Secretary-General of our Organization. I am confident, 
Sir, that your able leadership, steadfastness and 
commitment will assist us in our search for consensual 
solutions to the issues that affect humanity in order to 
make the world an increasingly safer, freer and fairer 
place. 
 Today, the world is confronted with global 
warming, a consequence of the atmospheric pollution 
resulting from human activity on Earth, which is 
causing dramatic and dangerous climate change. The 
world is also confronted with extremists who resort to 
terrorism and the use of religion for political ends; with 
growing militarism as a would-be response to 
terrorism; and with the hoarding of capital, information 
and know-how, all of which widen the gap between the 
rich and the poor and generate social tensions around 
the world. 
 On the issue of terrorism, the model of an open, 
democratic and tolerant civilization, with a State that 
serves the interests of all, has shown that parties that 
alternate in political office in the post-cold-war period 
can coexist and fight for their principles and values 
through peaceful means. I believe that the same model 
can be successful if properly adjusted to the concrete 
realities of other regions. 
 At the same time, we must continue to deepen our 
study and analysis of the threat of terrorism and use 
peaceful means to seek an ever-broader consensus on 
the collective responses needed to counter it.  
 Islam can peacefully coexist in societies with 
other religious beliefs. However, it is necessary to 
neutralize fanaticism and prevent the Islamization of 
the State, which is contrary to humanity’s modern legal 
concept of a secular State. 
 In our opinion, it is necessary to defend cultural 
diversity and to render more inclusive and fair the 
process of political, economic and social development; 
to support and stimulate, in countries that are 
predominantly Islamic, all the forces and movements 
that defend modern life and the separation of State 
from religion; and to support the values and privileges 
of the universal culture that are enshrined in 
conventions, charters and international treaties. This 
movement is immense, it continues to grow and it can 
be more effective than military action, which in our 
understanding should only constitute a last resort.  
 Ecumenism and dialogue among cultures are 
other avenues for action that can be better and more 
frequently used to bring together the dominant 
religions and all the people of the world, based on the 
ideals of peace, solidarity and fraternity. 
 The fight against poverty and hunger in the 
world, with a global plan monitored by the United 
Nations as an international convention, higher and 
fairer remuneration for commodities or natural 
resources extracted from developing countries and 
technical support to poor States would contribute 
greatly to eliminating social inequalities and the social 
seedbed and support of those who prefer violence. 
 In this regard, the globalization of the economy 
must be regulated in order to mitigate the asymmetries 
between the centre and the periphery of the economic 
system and to ensure that each person has the 
necessary means for survival with dignity. 
 Such regulation should further address 
environmental matters. There are countries that have 
experienced rapid industrial development without 
paying due attention to the protection of the 
environment. Other countries are now involved in an 
identical endeavour, thus increasing the production of 
carbon dioxide and worsening the greenhouse effect. It 
is plain that a new meeting of all world leaders is 
urgently required in order to approve and begin the 
execution of a global plan of environmental protection. 
 We therefore support the initiative of the 
Secretary-General to that end, convinced that the 
countries that most pollute the atmosphere, such as the 
richest countries, should contribute more resources to 
its protection. 
 Today, the Republic of Angola is in a position to 
engage more actively in this collective effort of 
solidarity for humanity, because the country has been 
at peace for a little more than five years and is moving 
towards complete normalization of its political, 
economic and social life. Proof of that lies in the fact 
that Angola has already signed all the international 
protocols in favour of environmental protection, such 
as the Kyoto and the Montreal Protocols, while 
contributing to conflict resolution and peace in its 
region and in the African continent as a whole. 
 As a country that has recently chaired the 
Peacebuilding Commission, we are pleased to learn of 
the important progress achieved in consolidating the 
peace processes in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and Serra 
Leone. 
 However, the conflict between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea and the conflict in Darfur, Sudan, still prevail, 
while the issue of Western Sahara’s self-determination 
remains unresolved. I am convinced that the 
Organization will remain engaged in the search for a 
solution to these problems in the shortest time possible 
and that United Nations forces will be urgently 
deployed in Darfur. 
 The Commission of the Gulf of Guinea is 
currently headquartered in Luanda, where the 
representatives of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation 
of the South Atlantic met recently at the initiative of 
Angola. Both institutions promote peace, security, 

stability and multiform cooperation among their 
members, in consonance with the principles of the 
United Nations Charter. 
 I must highlight the decisive role that regional 
and subregional organizations can play in the 
prevention and resolution of conflicts. At the same 
time, they can alert everyone to the need to strengthen 
the mandates and the financing of United Nations 
peacekeeping operations, without prejudice to post-
conflict activities, such as disarmament and the 
resettlement of populations, among other actions. 
 In the particular case of Africa, it is in our 
interest to see the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) fully achieved, so that the growth rate of the 
entire continent can be aligned with that of the world 
economy. The reduction of extreme poverty by 50 per 
cent by 2015, as foreseen by the United Nations, must 
be accompanied by a decisive fight against hunger and 
disease, including HIV/AIDS and other endemic 
scourges. The effectiveness of these actions depends, 
however, on complementary achievements, such as 
fairer trade with developed countries, greater fluidity 
in the transfer of capital, official development 
assistance and forgiveness of foreign debt. 
 In recent years, significant progress has been 
made in the reform of the United Nations system. It is 
nevertheless important to continue to move forward in 
that process, especially in regard to the Security 
Council, with the objective of strengthening the 
authority and the effectiveness of the Organization and 
making it more representative, more democratic and 
more participatory in the areas of international security, 
development and human rights. 
 In spite of criticism and some known failures, the 
United Nations remains the only institution at the 
international level with the prestige and credibility to 
resolve inter-State conflicts and crises that, due to their 
dimensions, escape the control of the authorities of a 
State or endanger its population. 
 The United Nations-led fight against 
conventional, nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons and landmines, in addition to the 
peacekeeping and humanitarian operations of the Blue 
Helmets in many regions, have contributed to greater 
world security. In that regard, it is important to 
strengthen the monitoring of the implementation of the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
(NPT), so as to move towards a global disarmament 
process and discourage a new arms race. It is also 
urgent to relaunch the Middle East peace process in a 
committed and comprehensive manner, for the Middle 
East remains unstable and the source of a constant 
threat to world peace. 
 A recurring theme in the Assembly’s agenda is 
the embargo against Cuba. It is imperative to put an 
end once and for all to the economic, trade and 
financial embargo imposed by the United States of 
America, as it violates the principles of international 
law and Chapters I and II of the United Nations 
Charter. Angola hopes that the United Nations will 
state its view on this matter and remain faithful to the 
core of its Charter, according to which all actions must 
be the result of a debate and a collective decision, thus 
excluding unilateralism. 
 The challenges that lie ahead of us entail a 
constructive dialogue among all the countries involved, 
especially among heads of State and Government, who 
will have to overcome possible differences and 
impediments and will have to find middle ground 
between the possible and the desirable, between 
boldness and realism. 
 We believe that through joint action, the 
promotion of dialogue among civilizations and the 
revitalization of the spirit of international solidarity, it 
will be possible to build a better world for all. A world 
of peace, based on justice and the rule of law, without 
weapons of war and without dangerous pollution is a 
safer world. Its construction depends entirely on the 
political will of all States Members of the United 
Nations, especially the permanent members of the 
Security Council. Let us all unite our forces for a better 
world for all.
"
AGO,1987,"﻿
First of all, Sir, please allow me, on behalf of my Government, to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the office of President of the General Assembly at this session. There can be no doubt that your election is testimony to, and recognition of, your personal devotion to the struggle that is being waged by the international community to realize the rights of peoples to freedom and independence. It is likewise a well deserved tribute to the country you represent so worthily. I should like therefore to take this opportunity to convey to you our best wishes for success in carrying out your task.
Permit me to take this opportunity also to express my appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh, for the outstanding, very wise and skilful way in which he was able to overcome the obstacles to his mandate and to carry out successfully his difficult mission. It would be unpardonable if I were not also to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, for his untiring efforts in the quest for solutions to the many problems still facing mankind and for his devotion to the basic principles of the Organization, despite the limited means available to him and the political and economic circumstances which are so difficult and which characterize today's world.
Allow me also to congratulate Mr. Reed on his recent nomination to the high post of Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs.
At the same time every year, the representatives of most of the nations of the world meet in this same hall to take up the questions that afflict mankind and to try to find lasting solutions to them. Despite this, the spectres of famine, drought, underdevelopment and foreign debt continue to haunt the minds of the leaders of the least developed countries, and these factors, together with the unbridled arms race, particularly in the nuclear sphere, continue to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. Moreover, the arms race remains, we feel, a grave threat to the survival of all of mankind.
The Government of the People's Republic of Angola is convinced that a policy of dialogue and harmonization is the only assurance of a genuine policy for reducing conflicts and tensions among nations thus creating a climate of trust conducive not only to the peaceful settlement of disputes but also to disarmament. We therefore welcome the historic meeting between the leaders of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany which took place less than three weeks ago, as well as the agreement of principle reached between the Soviet Union and the United States of America several days ago to sign a treaty on the total elimination of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
The problems of development are inseparable from the problem of peace.
Without peace there is no stability and without stability there will be no possibility of development. The implementation of the development programmes in our country is inseparable from political and economic stability. This requires solving the so-called regional conflicts which some of our countries have faced either directly or indirectly. In our humble opinion these efforts for peace should be made by the international community as a whole. For that reason the Government of the People's Republic of Angola supports the idea of the creation of a fund for the economic and social development of the developing countries.
Indeed, the problem of underdevelopment facing most of the third-world countries is widening the gap that already exists between the rich and poor nations and thus constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.
In this context, we hail the holding, under the auspices of the United Nations, of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. To be sure, much remains to be done: there are many gaps in the final document and it does not reflect all the hopes of the underdeveloped countries, particularly the hope for the establishment of a development fund for the developing countries. The holding of the Conference and the adoption by consensus of a final document by the Conference, despite the attempts to frustrate it, are, in any case, an important milestone in the efforts we are all making to attain our objectives of peace and security. It marks a beginning and we hope that this trend will continue and increase and that it will yield much more tangible results for the benefit of peace and development.
Moved as we are by the desire to contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the United Nations Charter, the African countries are sparing no effort to keep our continent free of nuclear weapons. The People's Republic of Angola feels that the proclamation of the southern Atlantic as a zone of peace and co-operation, free of nuclear arms and military pacts, is a sure way to guarantee peaceful co-existence. In this context, the independence of Namibia, on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) , and the elimination of apartheid would also contribute to strengthening international security and co-operation in the region in the mutual interests of the countries of the southern Atlantic region.
Allow me to express our profound gratitude for the untiring efforts of the international community and of the United Nations to find fair and lasting solutions to the problems of our times. Nevertheless, I cannot fail to express my concern at the fact that there remain many unresolved issues, such as decolonisation, apartheid, famine and drought.
Since its independence almost 12 years ago the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has followed a policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. This policy is set down in its constitutional law, which establishes, as clearly as possible, its intention to maintain diplomatic relations with all the countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect, sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of each State, and respect for the norms of international law governing relations among independent States.
Unfortunately, in the sub-region of southern Africa, a reactionary and anachronistic regime, that of racist South Africa, continues to flout United Nations resolutions and arrogantly carries out, with impunity, acts of subversion and destabilization against the countries of the area, including my own, with the sole purpose of perpetuating its illegal occupation of Namibia and thereby delay the elimination of the odious system of apartheid.
We are a people that cherishes peace and justice, but ever since our country achieved independence we have not known a single day of peace. In an undeclared war imposed on it, Angola has been victimized by acts of armed aggression on the part of the racist regime of South Africa. Our people and our Government are thus obliged to make enormous sacrifices for the effects of the war are fraught with heavy consequences in terms of our financial, material and human resources and inevitably undermine the economic and social development of our country.
In this unjust war imposed on us by South Africa, women, children and the elderly have no defence, and our basic infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railroads, hospitals, schools and industrial plants, is not spared; these are indeed the preferred targets of the South African army and its UNITA auxiliary forces.
The damage suffered by our country as a result of the atrocities committed by the South African regular army and the UNITA puppets is estimated today at more than $US 12 billion. That figure does not include lost earnings resulting from the fact that our young people are engaged in military service, instead of attending school or working in factories where they would be contributing to increasing production and improving the living standard of our population.
After achieving independence at the cost of great sacrifices our people aspire to life in peace and the reconstruction of their country; they wish to build a strong nation by exploiting the vast natural potential of our soil.
Contrary to what some of the media would have international public opinion believe, there is no civil war in our country, it is in fact a case of foreign invasion of a State Member of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, part of whose territory remains occupied by the racist South African troops. That is why the People's Republic of Angola continues to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from the southern part of its territory.
South Africa is using Namibia's territory as a springboard for acts of aggression against Angolan territory. Thus South African military bases - where armed bandits and mercenaries are trained and later sent to our territory, and from where South African troops carry out incursions into our territory - are to be found in the north of occupied Namibia.
In the face of these facts, and based on the rights recognized under international law and the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter, particularly Article 51 the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has appealed for assistance from friendly countries, in particular Cuba and the Soviet Union - assistance for which we wish once again to express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, aware of the complexity of the situation in southern Africa and in order to remove the impasse created by South Africa and its allies with regard to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) , the Government of the People's Republic of Angola submitted an approach to global negotiations contained in its letter, dated 17 November 1984, addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, by the President of the People's Republic of Angola, Mr. Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.
Despite this gesture of understanding and goodwill on the part of the Angolan Government, the plan for the independence of Namibia still faces the intransigence of the Government of South Africa and its allies.
Once again, in a spirit of co-operation and openness, ray Government very recently proposed to the parties concerned, the general framework for a comprehensive agreement on the settlement of the Namibian question, a solution taking into account not only the legitimate right of the people of Namibia - under the leadership of its sole, genuine representative, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - to self-determination and independence, in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1970) , but also the right of the other countries of the region to live in peace and security. The agreement would be signed by the representatives of the Governments of Angola, Cuba and South Africa and of SWAPO, under the auspices of the Security Council or its permanent members.
Moreover, the recent talks held in Luanda between representatives of the 
Angolan Government and the United States Administration clearly show my Government's constant readiness to seek a solution to the problems of peace and security in southern Africa. It is now up to the regime of South Africa and the United States Administration to accept or reject this new olive branch. If they persist in their obstinacy, history will judge them, for in wanting to link the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to the withdrawal of the internationalist Cuban troops from Angola the South African regime and its allies are simply invoking a cowardly and fallacious pretext to prevent the independence of Namibia and allow South Africa to continue using its territory as a base for aggression against and the destabilization of the People's Republic of Angola and other States of southern Africa, thus interfering with our efforts for national reconstruction.
Twenty years have now elapsed since the establishment of the United Nations Council for Namibia. But we must note that implementation of its mandate is being obstructed by the intransigence of the apartheid regime. Such behaviour is possible only because of the support and encouragement that some Western countries continue to give it. In view of the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African regime, the international community must now adopt firm measures to ensure that international legal order is restored.
In South Africa we are witnessing extremely violent confrontations between the power of the white racist minority on the one hand and the oppressed and exploited black people on the other hand. New facts, however, have recently surfaced. Some elements of the white minority are beginning to understand that only a policy of dialogue and harmony can avoid a bloodbath with unforeseeable consequences. Thus, a delegation of white South Africans met with a delegation of the African National Congress (ANC) in Senegal. This is one more proof that many members of the white minority recognize the role of the ANC in the solution of the problem of South Africa. The People's Republic of Angola commends the courageous action of that group of South African citizens who have dared to defy the repressive power of apartheid. We feel that such initiatives open the way to a peaceful solution in South Africa and should be encouraged.
Unfortunately, despite these positive steps, the present political picture within South Africa remains sombre. The racist regime continues to use oppression as its main weapon against the patriots of South Africa, as was the case in the recent cruel repression of the striking miners, who were seeking fair wages and the satisfaction of their just social claims. This alarming situation in South Africa presents a greater challenge than ever before to the international community, which should without further delay tackle the root causes of these phenomena that are endangering regional and international security and stability. The total elimination of apartheid and the end of the illegal occupation of Namibia must therefore be demanded.
Consequently, the Government of the People's Republic of Angola believes that comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter should be imposed as a form of pressure on the racist South African Government,
It is disquieting to note that despite some encouraging signs the international situation continues to be darkened by the persistence of various other hotbeds of tension.
On the African continent the Western Sahara conflict continues to affect the lives of the people of the territory. We believe that the implementation of resolution AHG/104 of the 19th Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) would make a great contribution to the settlement of the conflict. We therefore appeal to the parties concerned to continue the dialogue begun through the intermediary of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Concerning Chad, we hope that peace will be restored in that country in the interest of well-being and social progress of its people.
The Middle East, where the State of Israel continues to carry out its aggressive expansionist policies against the Arab people, is another source of serious concern for us. We reaffirm the sacred and inalienable right of the Palestinian people, under the enlightened leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO), to form their own State. We thus support the idea of convening an international conference on the Palestinian problem, with the participation of the PLO, and hope that this session can take the relevant measures to bring this about as rapidly as possible.
We advocate respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon and the safeguarding of its independence, and we oppose foreign interference in the internal affairs of that State.
The war between Iran and Iraq cannot fail to concern us, too, since it is a war between two non-aligned countries that seriously threatens international peace and security. We hope for an early end to that war.
We also note with great concern that the question of East Timor remains deadlocked. We call for a dialogue between Indonesia and Portugal, with the mediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to find a just and lasting solution that takes into account the interests and rights of the Maubere people. The situation in the Korean peninsula is also a source of alarm for us. We welcome the initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the reunification of the great homeland of the Koreans and cannot support the admission of the two parties separately to the great family of the United Nations.
 We welcome with great satisfaction the initiatives of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea with regard to its policy of national reconciliation and are convinced that these will contribute to peace and stability in the region.
In Latin America, we welcome the positive results achieved by the Heads of State of the five Central American countries - Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala - at their last meeting and hope that these results will contribute to peace and thereby reduce instances of foreign interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region.
We condemn the policy of intimidation, aggression, blackmail and economic blockade directed against Cuba and advocate the immediate cessation of the occupation of the Guantanamo base.
We reaffirm our support for the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence, in accordance with resolution 1514 (XV) and the Declaration adopted by the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Harare, Zimbabwe, last year.
The world economic situation has hardly improved since the last session of the General Assembly, and the economic and financial crisis has become established and taken root in all the developing countries. The growing indebtedness is preventing those countries from carrying out their national recovery plans and becoming, as a result, an additional factor of instability and insecurity.
The absence of the political will on the part of some developed countries to respond to the appeals of the international community, the arms race and the political instability created in some regions have helped to make the imbalance already existing in international economic relations even worse. The present structural crisis is also the result of the anachronistic development of the world economic system, which is shown by the fact that some countries are becoming ever richer, while the overwhelming majority of countries are becoming ever poorer and lack the means with which to tackle the problems of under development.
The foreign debt is the clearest indicator of the scope and gravity of the world economic crisis. To deal with this, political effort and will are necessary not only on the part of the developing countries, which are at present the most affected, but also and above all on the part of the developed countries.
The Government of the People's Republic of Angola continues to advocate the establishment of a new international economic order as an effective tool for overcoming the crisis and restoring balance to international economic relations.
With regard to the present financial and monetary system, we feel that our action should be oriented towards its restructuring as quickly as possible so that the developing countries can participate in the taking of decisions and profit as much as possible thereby. Scrupulous respect by the developed countries, for the principles, rules and norms in force in this area would also contribute to avoiding deterioration of the situation and exacerbation of the crisis
The proliferation of discriminatory measures imposed by the developed countries in their trade with the developing countries, protectionism and other restrictive measures are resulting in the reduction of the earnings from products exported by the developing countries and a consequent reduction in the resources and funds available for development. However, all these measures required of the developed countries should not prevent the developing countries from themselves taking steps to restructure the management of their economies in such a way as to facilitate the task of those of the rich countries that wish to help them to overcome the crisis. 
My country has just taken various measures along those lines. In this context, the People's Republic of Angola reaffirms the importance of the ratification by both developed and developing countries of the Integrated Programme for Commodities, dealt with in resolution 93 (IV) of the fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IV) , and its Fund in order to permit its rapid entry into force. We therefore welcome the Soviet Government's decision to subscribe to the Fund.
In the context of co-operation, the People's Republic of Angola also reaffirms the role of economic co-operation between developing countries - South-South co-operation - as a means of promoting the rational and effective use of their human, material, financial and technological resources. In this context, co-operation between the States of southern Africa in the framework of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) has already yielded significant results in various sectors, as acknowledged by the regional Heads of State or Government at their last summit meeting in Lusaka.
However, we recognize that much remains to be done. The convening by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) next December of a conference of Heads of State and Government devoted to the foreign debt of the African countries reflects the importance that our countries attach to this problem and the political will to combine their efforts to redress Africa's economic situation.
In reviewing all these situations, we have tried to interpret in our own way the problems of peace and development and to express our desire for the progress and well-being of all mankind. In this context, we reaffirm our devotion to the principles of the United Nations and to multilateralism as a whole as an instrument for seeking solutions to the complex problems of a world that is growing more and more interdependent.
The struggle continues. Victory is certain.
"
AGO,2014,"On behalf of 
the Government of the Republic of Angola, allow me 
to congratulate you, Mr. Sam Kutesa, on your election 
as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth 
session, and to assure you of my country’s support as 
you fulfil your mission. I would also like to congratulate 
Ambassador John William Ashe for the competent 
manner in which he led the work of the previous 
session. We extend our greetings to Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon and commend him for his commitment to 
finding solutions to the issues facing the international 
community.

This session of the General Assembly is taking 
place in an environment that gives rise to concern 
due to the aggravation of international tensions, the 
intensification of conflicts and the deepening of global 
crises that require effective and sustainable solutions. 
It is a matter of consensus that the solutions to common 
challenges are to be found in multilateral negotiations 
and should take into account the specificities of each 


country and each people. The United Nations has 
always been and will continue to be the mainstay of 
Member States’ participation in decision-making on 
issues of concern to the international community and 
in upholding the global values of tolerance and peaceful 
and harmonious coexistence of countries and peoples, 
in accordance with the principles set forth in the Charter 
of the United Nations and international law.

Angola would once again like to reiterate the 
importance of all Member States joining in efforts 
to make the United Nations a strong and effective 
organization, and one that serves as the basis for a more 
balanced, fair and inclusive international legal order 
and global security system, while promoting confidence 
among States and strengthening relations of friendship 
and international cooperation. Our Organization should 
pay special attention to the resurgence of armed conflicts 
and their negative effects on populations, as well as to 
arms flows, trafficking in drugs and human beings, 
transnational organized crime, international terrorism 
and piracy — all phenomena that have an adverse 
impact on economic development and consequently 
impede the improvement of living conditions.

Religious fundamentalism in some African 
countries is taking on such violent proportions that 
it poses a threat to regional security, with serious 
consequences for peace, stability and development. 
Angola strongly condemns the acts committed by 
terrorist groups and expresses its support for efforts to 
ensure the full neutralization of those groups. Angola 
supports efforts to strengthen the crisis-management 
capacity of the United Nations and considers dialogue 
and negotiation to be the best means of resolving 
conflicts.

We will continue to meet our international 
obligations, with special emphasis on the African 
continent and the regional groupings in which we 
operate, including the Southern African Development 
Community, the Economic Community of Central 
African States, the African countries that use Portuguese 
as an official language, the Gulf of Guinea Commission 
and the International Conference on the Great Lakes 
Region, with a view to defining mechanisms and forms 
of cooperation with the United Nations, the African 
Union, the Community of Portuguese-speaking 
Countries and other international partners.

Angola assumed the rotating presidency of the 
International Conference on the Great Lakes Region 
in January, and in that forum continues to promote the 
resolution of conflicts on the African continent with a 
view to attaining stability, political and institutional 
development, internal and border security, good 
governance and human rights. It is in that context 
that Angola is engaged in the peace processes in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African 
Republic and the Great Lakes region.

The Ebola epidemic is an issue of great concern. 
The position of the Security Council, which declared 
the epidemic to be a threat to international peace and 
security, fully reflects the seriousness of the situation. 
A decisive commitment on the part of the international 
community is required if the scourge is to be combated 
and eradicated.

We reiterate the need to reform and revitalize the 
United Nations system, in particular the need to reform 
the Security Council, which should be brought into 
line with the current international context and whose 
membership should reflect an equitable geographical 
representation through an increase in the number of 
permanent members. Angola reiterates the right of the 
African continent to sit among the permanent members 
of the Council.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the lack of 
progress in finding a lasting solution are a major cause 
of widespread instability in the Middle East, and 
also the root cause of the resurgence of terrorism in 
the region. That situation worries the Government of 
Angola. We call for political will and flexibility from 
both parties, and we encourage the Secretary-General 
and the United States Secretary of State to continue 
their mediation efforts with a view to establishing a 
sovereign and independent Palestinian State, as well as 
a modus vivendi to ensure that the two States coexist 
in peace and security within internationally recognized 
borders.

The impasse in resolving the question of Western 
Sahara continues to delay the exercise of the right 
to self-determination of the people of that territory. 
Angola calls on the parties to continue negotiations 
under the auspices of the United Nations and the 
African Union in order to find a solution in accordance 
with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
and resolution 1514 (XV) of December 1960.

With regard to the situation in the Ukraine, Angola 
deplores the loss of human lives caused by instability 


in the region and calls for dialogue between the parties 
involved to find a political solution to the conflict.

The situations in Somalia and South Sudan 
remain cause for concern. However, there has been 
some encouraging progress, which is why we urge 
the authorities in those countries and the international 
community to continue their efforts for stabilization. 
Angola welcomes the constitutional normalization in 
some African countries. We welcome the holding of 
democratic elections in Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar 
and Egypt, and we express our solidarity with the 
national reconciliation and reconstruction processes 
and the economic and social development in those 
countries.

The Government of Angola expresses its 
appreciation for the choice of the central theme of 
this session, “Delivering on and implementing a 
transformative post-2015 development agenda”. It is 
greatly relevance, especially for the least developed 
countries. The progress made in some of those 
countries is far behind the targets of the Millennium 
Development Goals, due to structural issues, and is 
insufficient to mitigate the persistent effects of the 
economic problems.

With one year remaining until the final assessment 
of the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals, our economies continue to suffer the effects of 
the international economic and financial crisis, which 
create barriers to economic growth and hinder the 
implementation of programmes to combat poverty and 
improve the living conditions of our peoples. However, 
we note with satisfaction that the African continent 
has ceased to present the image of desolation it did at 
the beginning of the millennium. A new reality has 
emerged in which African countries boast an average 
growth of 5 per cent per year and improvements in 
several human development indicators. We believe that 
the trend of progress will prevail in the near future, 
and we will do everything to make it so by investing in 
future generations on the basis of the objectives of the 
New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the post-
2015 road map and the African Agenda 2063.

Angola is implementing its National Development 
Plan 2013-2017, which aims to increase the supply of 
social services to the population, diversify the economy 
and consolidate macroeconomic stability, thus laying 
the foundation for the process of graduation to a 
middle-income country.

Angola reiterates the need to end the economic and 
financial embargo imposed on Cuba, which limits the 
right of the Cuban people to development and is a clear 
violation of the principles and rules of international law.

Finally, we appreciate and have been touched by 
the support that Angola has received from numerous 
countries for its candidature to be a non-permanent 
member of the Security Council for the 2015-2016 
biennium, elections for which will place during the 
Assembly’s present session. Once elected to that 
important organ, we will work with partners in the 
Council to seek solutions to the serious problems 
facing the international community and to make a real 
contribution to peace and security in the world.
"
AGO,2001,"﻿Allow me to
start by congratulating you, Mr. President, on behalf of
my Government and myself, on your election to the
presidency of the United Nations General Assembly.
Your election is an acknowledgement of the many
contributions made by the Republic of Korea to United
Nations efforts to maintain international peace and
security, as well as to promote the economic and social
development of our peoples.
This session is being held during a period of
major challenges to our Organization and the
international community in general.
Peace and security continue to be endangered by
many armed conflicts, particularly in Africa, as well as
by terrorist activities launched systematically or
sporadically against some countries. Extreme poverty
and misery still affect large numbers of the world
population, especially in my continent, where one
fourth of our 800 million inhabitants survive on less
than $1 per day. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, now
affecting more than 36 million people, most of them
economically active people, may seriously threaten the
economic development and future of many societies
unless urgent measures are taken.
To face these and many other challenges, the
United Nations must continue to improve its internal
structure, including the Security Council, whose
membership must be reconsidered to allow for a more
equitable geographic balance. In addition, its working
methods should be restructured to ensure effective
implementation of its decisions.
The United Nations must also endeavour to
implement the action plans and recommendations
adopted over the last decade, with a view to resolving
problems in the areas of HIV/AIDS, social
development, human rights, racism and racial
discrimination, as well as terrorism.
At the last session of the General Assembly, my
Government voted in favour of resolution 55/158, on
measures to eliminate international terrorism. We
continue to believe that its implementation will be
essential to fighting this enemy. Terrorism is an
international scourge with many faces. No country is
immune to this heinous evil, and to fight it, we must
cooperate at the bilateral, regional and international
levels, under the leadership of the United Nations.
Angola reiterates its firm condemnation of the 11
September terrorist attacks, which victimized
thousands of innocent civilians and endorses the use of
force to eliminate terrorist networks and their support
bases.
Having been subjected to terrorism for many
years, Angola is pleased to join all other States in this
anti-terrorist campaign. In this context, we have joined
the other members of the Southern Africa Development
Council to promote a forum to discus and identify the
many faces of terrorism, as well as effective means to
prevent and fight its activities in and from our region.
As to the African continent, we believe measures
to combat terrorism should particularly address its
sources of financing, such as the illicit diamond, drug
and weapons traffic, and identify its networks in order
to prevent the free circulation of its members.
In partnership with some countries, Angola has
developed an international diamond certification
system that has prevented diamonds originating from
illegal traffic to reach international markets. Thus, we
have helped prevent the financing of terrorist groups
and their activities in many countries of our continent.
At this stage, the struggle against terrorism
requires that, beyond the measures encompassed by
Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), special
attention be devoted to the completion of an
international convention against terrorism. This legal
instrument could eliminate some of the ambiguities
still surrounding the definition of this phenomenon.
23

My Government is firmly committed to peace in
Angola, the African continent and the world as a
whole. After a period of uncertainty, peace is slowly
becoming an irreversible reality in Angola. The regular
forces of UNITA’s militarist wing, which had launched
a large-scale military campaign to seize power, have
been completely neutralized. Counties under their
illegal control have been liberated and the Angolan
Government now controls the entire national territory.
Large numbers of rebel soldiers and officers
surrendering their weapons and being integrated into
Angolan society is now a daily event. Today UNITA’s
military wing has only small groups, inadequately
armed in the jungle or in remote areas of our large
territory. Although they can make isolated armed
attacks, they do not represent a threat anymore to
Angolan democratic institutions or to the safety of
most of our population.
My Government believes that the Lusaka
Protocol continues to be a valid formula for resolving
problems related to peace and national reconciliation in
Angola.
The climate of peace that is starting to prevail is
having favourable repercussions on the country’s
economy. Although considerable distortions and
weaknesses still exist, reform efforts under way can
help overcome serious social problems and enable
general elections to be held in the near future in a truly
democratic environment.
As a result of a long period of war, Angola still
needs the support of the international community in its
effort to alleviate the problems of poverty, displaced
persons and refugees, and to rebuild its infrastructure.
The environment of relative peace would not be
possible without the help of the international
community, which has made the distinction between
those who are committed to peace and democracy and
the proponents of war, and has imposed Security
Council sanctions against UNITA’s militarist wing led
by Jonas Savimbi. The most visible effect of these
sanctions has been their contribution to a significant
reduction of Savimbi’s capacity to wage war and, as a
result, to persuade a great number of UNITA members
to give up their weapons and join the peace effort.
That outcome clearly demonstrates the efficacy of
the sanctions as a means, and not as an end in
themselves. That is why my Government favours
keeping and tightening them until peace becomes
irreversible in Angola. Nevertheless, my Government
is still concerned with the findings of United Nations
reports, according to which not all countries have fully
adopted measures called for by the sanctions
resolutions.
The Security Council resolutions on sanctions
against UNITA were adopted in accordance with the
powers given to the Council by the United Nations
Charter. All nations are legally obligated to abide by
and implement those resolutions. The resulting
obligations on the Member States prevail over any
inconsistent obligation to which they might be subject
by virtue of any other treaty or international agreement
to which they are, or may become, party. That principle
should also be applied with regard to sanctions against
UNITA.
The Angolan Government considers inconsistent
the arguments put forward by certain Governments —
some of which have a privileged relationship with
Angola — of a supposed incompatibility between their
internal legislation and Security Council resolutions.
We appeal to those countries to reverse their position
and to take the measures required. This, we believe,
will contribute to the development of harmonious
bilateral relationships with Angola.
Angola is firmly committed to a search for peace
in the Great Lakes region, and particularly in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are pleased
with the positive results achieved lately by the peace
process. In general terms, the ceasefire has been
adhered to and foreign troops have been withdrawn.
Angola, for example, has withdrawn 75 per cent of its
troops. Namibia has completed its withdrawal, and
both Zimbabwe and Uganda have started to repatriate
their respective armies. Only Rwanda has not yet taken
any step to signal its willingness to withdraw its forces,
and therefore to fulfil its basic obligation as a signatory
to the Lusaka Agreement and the obligations of the
pertinent resolutions of the Security Council. We are
hopeful that proper preparation of the inter-Congolese
dialogue will lead to a substantive discussion of the
relevant questions regarding the political future of the
country.
As regards Burundi, Angola salutes the
establishment of a transitional Government, which is a
direct outcome of the Pretoria agreement, for which the
mediation efforts of former President Nelson Mandela

were so crucial. We hope this step will soon lead to
peace and stability in Burundi and good-neighbourly
relations with bordering countries.
With regard to Western Sahara, Angola thinks it
is necessary to find a solution acceptable to both
parties that makes it possible to overcome the barriers
to the implementation of a plan to resolve the conflict.
My Government encourages the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to persist in their
efforts in that direction.
The international community should not forget
the problems of Somalia. The establishment of a
Transitional National Government is an important step
on the way to a peaceful resolution of the internal
conflict there. Both the United Nations and the OAU
should support that step in order that Somalia can
return to its rightful place in the community of nations.
Angola is also concerned with the deterioration of
the peace process in the Middle East, which has
resulted from the recent intensification of the violence.
We believe that a resolution of the conflict between
Israel and Palestine will require negotiations. We
therefore appeal to the parties to continue their
dialogue and to abide by the agreements they signed
and by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.
Angola is pleased with the advances achieved by
the fraternal people of East Timor in their struggle for
the right to self-determination and independence. The
political, moral and diplomatic support that Angola and
other members of the international community have
been providing through the years in major international
forums was decisive in enabling the people of the
territory to reach a point where they can finally choose
their destiny in freedom. The Timorese are now
preparing to proclaim the birth of a new, independent,
sovereign and democratic nation, but they will continue
to need the support of the United Nations for the
consolidation of their institutions.
The international economic recession will have a
major impact on developing countries, and on Africa in
particular, which has already suffered the effects of
globalization. Of course, African countries cannot
avoid globalization. But to engage in cooperative and
collective activities, African nations must be based in
strong States, something that hardly exists in the
continent.
In the New Partnership for Africa’s Development
(NEPAD), the countries of the continent have found a
way to break away from stagnation and to promote
inter-African cooperation and achieve development.
Angola is engaged in the New Partnership. Economic
progress can be achieved in Africa through the
promotion of trade among its nations, the establishment
of healthy economic conditions and good governance,
fighting regional threats — including conflicts and
endemic diseases — and welcoming capital inflows.
We hope that NEPAD will become a force for political
stabilization and economic development in African
countries, particularly those affected by serious
divisions.
The International Conference on Financing for
Development, to be held in Monterrey, Mexico, must
be an opportunity to mobilize resources for
development, particularly for the 49 least developed
countries, 34 of which are in Africa, and to alleviate
the extreme poverty under which more than 600
million people are now living.





"
AGO,2002,"﻿Allow me, on
behalf of my Government and in my own name, to
salute Mr. Kavan on his election to the presidency of
the General Assembly. We are convinced that his
knowledge and diplomatic experience will guide us to
success in our activities.
As the international situation remains caught in
the throes of instability, insecurity, economic
backwardness and the scourge of pandemics and
hunger, we nevertheless note with pleasure the great
progress that has been made since our last session.
After decades of conflict, peace was finally restored
throughout southern Africa and is now slowly
becoming a reality in other regions. The people of East
Timor were finally able to assert their self-
determination and independence. Countries such as
Angola, which have actively advocated the legitimate
rights and interests of East Timor at the United
Nations, take great pleasure in welcoming that new
sister republic to the family of this world Organization.
Important advances were also made by the
international community in the struggle against
terrorism. Thanks to a global and coordinated effort,
major terrorist networks have been dismembered.
Angola reiterates its strong condemnation of terrorist
acts, such as that perpetrated against the American
22

people in September last year. Angola continues to be
committed to the strict implementation of Security
Council resolution 1373 (2001). We support stronger
control measures, particularly in the financial area, so
as increasingly to curb the scope of action of terrorist
groups.
All these advances underscore the fact that, in
spite of their complexity, the serious problems that
afflict our world today can be resolved. No country or
region should be doomed to live forever under the
scourge of war and terror or be deprived of its rights.
Under the auspices of the United Nations, the
international community must react to crisis situations
expeditiously and effectively. Experience has shown
that belated and ineffectual reactions lead to the
escalation of protracted and intractable conflicts,
especially in Africa. Fortunately, however, the
individual and collective efforts of many Governments
in Africa are now easing these tensions, laying the
essential bases for a solid, just and lasting peace.
The current situation in Angola is a reflection of
that reality. For the first time since our independence,
Angola and Angolans are now enjoying a climate of
authentic peace, thanks to the allaying of factors that
could have provoked a resurgence of the past war and
insecurity. The efforts of the Angolan Government
have blazed the trail from a fratricidal war towards
irreversible peace, thanks to the goodwill and profound
patriotic spirit demonstrated by all Angolans. Military
hostilities effectively ended seven months ago. The
peace understandings reached on 4 April have been
scrupulously adhered to. Armed political parties no
longer exist. Today, there is just one single army, under
the authority of the Angolan Government.
The peace process will soon be concluded with
the completion of the political tasks still pending under
the Lusaka Protocol. In Angola, the process of
economic and social rehabilitation is well under way
and Government institutions have begun to operate
normally throughout our national territory.
Clearly, given the current situation, it will be
difficult for the Angolan Government to rise
appropriately to the nation's economic and social
challenges. Our main challenge now lies in the
reintegration into society of thousands of combat
veterans, 4 million displaced persons, refugees and
thousands upon thousands of handicapped, war orphans
and widows.
On behalf of my Government, I would like to
avail myself of this opportunity to thank the Secretary-
General, members of the troika of observer nations in
the peace process and all those who, in various ways,
have contributed to the achievement of peace in Angola
and who have pledged their assistance to solve the
problems caused by the recently ended war.
Now at peace, Angola is more than ever ready
and willing to take up its role as a sister nation of
Africa and of the world. In the coming days, it will
assume the presidency of the Southern Africa
Development Community, the most important regional
organization for the economic integration of southern
Africa. Angola is also a candidate for a non-permanent
seat in the Security Council in the elections scheduled
for this session of the General Assembly. In these
bodies, Angola intends to contribute actively towards
an environment of stability, fostering the development
and economic welfare of our peoples. Of central
concern to Angola is the issue of peace in Central
Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. Only over time will it be possible to avert the
widespread destabilization of the region.
Angola has been a factor of stability in Central
Africa, having contributed substantially to the
cessation of the wave of violence and to the relative
peace now enjoyed by the population in the area.
In the context of these efforts, and under
Angola's aegis, the Presidents of the DRC and Uganda
signed an agreement in Luanda on 6 September. This
was seen as a crucial step for the complete settlement
of the Congolese conflict and for the establishment of
good neighbourly relations between the two countries.
Angola welcomes the diplomatic initiatives
undertaken by other countries to resolve the conflict,
whether or not they are involved in the conflict, under
the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and the
understandings reached by the Congolese parties
themselves. Angola advocates a new regional order of
peace, security, cooperation and development, to be
based on respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity, non-intervention in the internal affairs of
other States, democratic values and respect for human
rights. We are willing to work together with other
central and southern African countries and to offer
them our good offices.
The instability in some parts of the world requires
a greater measure of commitment by the United
23

Nations and the parties concerned for peace and
security. Special attention should continue to be
focused on the settlement of the Somali conflict,
fostering unification of the country and consolidation
of lasting peace there. In Western Sahara, we are
concerned at delays in the process towards a
referendum by those resident in the territory. Angola
urges the parties involved to show flexibility and to
continue cooperating with the United Nations and the
African Union towards a negotiated settlement.
In the Middle East, renewed escalation of the
violence may hamper current initiatives towards a
peaceful settlement of the Palestine issue and the
termination of Arab-Israeli crisis. We urge the parties
to return to the negotiating table and to find a political
settlement that will serve the best interests of all
peoples living in the region and meet their security
requirements.
Last July, the African States established the
African Union as a more effective tool to help in the
resolution of innumerable problems that are at the root
of underdevelopment, such as poverty, foreign debt,
lack of know-how and epidemics, among others. Our
priority is to end the current economic stagnation in
Africa. The establishment of the New Partnership for
Africa's Development reflects the determination of
African Governments to resolve the problems of
economic backwardness, poverty and social exclusion
that afflict the majority of their peoples and the
continuing marginalization of Africa from international
markets in terms of capital, services and goods. Angola
hopes that the international community, especially
donor nations, will lend Africa a helping hand by
increasing official development assistance on the basis
of fair and non-discriminatory criteria.
In closing, allow me to offer my hearty
congratulations to Switzerland as it joins our family of
members of the United Nations.













"
AGO,1993,"First of all, Sir,
on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola and
on my own behalf, I congratulate Ambassador Insanally
48 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
warmly on his unanimous election as President of the
General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I am
convinced that his proven experience and dedication to the
noble ideals of our Organization constitute a secure
guarantee of the success of this session.
To Mr. Stoyan Ganev, his predecessor, I should like to
express my sincere gratitude for his exemplary and unselfish
manner of directing the forty-seventh session of the General
Assembly. The results we obtained during that session are
undeniable testimony to his valiant contribution in the search
for just and lasting solutions to the grave problems with
which we are confronted.
We are very pleased to welcome the new Members of
our Organization. Their admission confirms the universal
vocation of the United Nations at a time when its actions are
felt all over the world.
To the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
I also want to express my Government’s satisfaction at the
devotion and energy he has shown during the first year of
his difficult mandate, whose principal objective was the
constant search for adequate solutions to the problems that
afflict all mankind. We would not be wrong to say that
under his leadership concrete and decisive steps have already
been taken towards the resolution of certain issues that
seemed too difficult to resolve.
In this context we salute his efforts, within the
framework of the restructuring and revitalization of the
United Nations system, to give the system a new vitality in
the fulfilment of its mission. We also support the
mechanisms established for the prevention of conflict, as
explained in the report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"",
whose sub-title includes the words ""Preventive diplomacy"".
My Government continues to support such initiatives and
commends the United Nations for the General Assembly’s
unanimous adoption of resolution 47/120 B at its forty-
seventh session on 20 September 1993.
Therefore, the restructuring and revitalization of our
Organization should include reform of the Security Council
so that it can respond to the realities of today’s world. We
understand that restructuring the Security Council -
specifically its enlargement - so that it can permit equitable
representation of all the regions of the globe is aimed at
guaranteeing greater representativeness, credibility and
efficiency. We think that the time has come for the defence
of peace and international security to be the responsibility of
all States.
Significant and far-reaching achievements have occurred
and are still occurring in international relations, after the end
of the East-West confrontation and the cold war. These
events are taking place in spite of the proliferation of armed
conflicts that put at risk the hope for peace and stability,
conditions that are indispensable for the promotion of
mutually advantageous international cooperation.
With the signing of the peace accords in Washington
between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the
Government of Israel, a new era has opened up for the peace
process in the Middle East. My Government commends the
signing of these accords and hopes that the international
community will continue to work for the rights of all the
people of that region, in particular so that the opportunity for
the Palestinian people to live in peace and freedom will be
an irreversible reality.
Regarding South Africa, it was with great satisfaction
that we heard, in the speech by Mr. Nelson Mandela in this
Hall on 24 September 1993, the announcement of the
organization of free and democratic elections in April 1994
and the call for the lifting of the sanctions. We also
commend the creation of the Transitional Executive Council,
which will put an end to three centuries of white minority
domination. From this rostrum, my Government would like
to add its voice in support of all the initiatives that aim for
a peaceful and negotiated solution in South Africa for the
peaceful transition of power to the black majority.
In this context, my Government hopes that the
international community will remain vigilant in order to
deter any attempt by extremist groups to derail the present
democratic process, which will culminate in the
establishment of the right to one man, one vote, in South
Africa.
While there has been encouraging progress with regard
to the conflicts in the Middle East and apartheid, it is
unfortunate that the same is not true in relation to other
conflicts, such as those in East Timor, the former
Yugoslavia, some States of the former Soviet Union,
Somalia, Liberia and my own country. As a matter of fact,
these conflicts and civil wars continue daily to kill thousands
of human beings and to impede the social and economic
development of the countries involved. We should like the
international community, and the United Nations in
particular, to give more attention to the resolution of these
conflicts, on the basis of international justice and legality.
I should like to express our solidarity with, and
encouragement to, the Government of Mozambique and our
Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 49
Mozambican brothers and sisters, so that they may, with
determination and patience, continue on the paths that will
lead that country to a lasting and peaceful solution within the
framework of the accords signed in Rome, whose
implementation should be scrupulously observed by all
interested parties, under the supervision of the United
Nations.
We welcome the positive signs which resulted from the
recent meeting regarding East Timor between the Ministers
of Foreign Trade of Portugal and Indonesia, under the
auspices of the Secretary-General.
We hope that this profitable dialogue will lead to a just
solution that takes into account the aspirations of the
Maubere people in accordance with the relevant resolutions
of the General Assembly and of the Security Council.
With regard to Western Sahara, my Government
supports the holding of the referendum on self-determination
for this Territory under the terms of the resolutions of the
Organization of African Unity and of the United Nations.
My Government also hopes that the existing obstacles will
be overcome as soon as possible.
There have lately been startling changes in the world
economic situation. This applies especially to third world
countries, particularly in Africa. In this regard, while we
witness almost linear economic growth in the developed
countries, a substantial decrease has been recorded in the
less developed countries.
The indebtedness and the debt servicing of the less
developed countries, together with the great decrease in the
prices of raw materials and the recession in the industrialized
countries, constitute the principal obstacle to their
development and to their full participation in the world
economy.
In summary, it may be said that the socio-economic
situation of the developing countries - in particular, the
countries of Africa - is alarming and requires the assistance
of international financial institutions.
Nevertheless, we are opposed to the doctrine that has
been termed the états en échec - the failed States - according
to which these countries are not able to resolve their
problems by themselves and, therefore, need new ""tutors"".
It seems to us important that certain political situations
that are a legacy of the past be revised with a view to
reaching agreement and reducing the great barriers that exist
and the mechanisms that jeopardize real cooperation for the
economic, technical and scientific advancement of the
developing countries. In this context, we propose a
restructuring of the mechanism of international management
for economic development and cooperation.
My Government shares the opinion that a successful
outcome to the forthcoming world conferences on economic
and social development and on population is of great
importance to the international community so that there may
be, at the highest level, an open and frank dialogue with a
view to finding the most equitable solutions to the most
diverse and burning issues concerning mankind: poverty,
hunger and malnutrition - in a word, ""underdevelopment"" -
that grip a great part of our planet.
I should like to refer also to the importance that my
Government attaches to environmental issues and the
attention that it pays to implementation of the
recommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference of
1992. In this context, the Government of Angola has
established the post of Secretary of State for the
Environment, whose purpose is to apply the
recommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference. In
addition, an inter-ministerial commission, with an essentially
consultative role, has been set up to study and follow closely
projects related to the activities of the United Nations
Economic and Social Council’s Commission on Sustainable
Development.
The promotion of and universal respect for human
rights remain the prerequisites for the strengthening of
international peace and security.
The Republic of Angola actively participated in the
World Conference on Human Rights, which was held in
Vienna, and supported the consensus view. Nevertheless,
Angola continues to believe that, in the broad sense, human
rights are universal. We believe that there must be no
selectivity in the observance of human rights. Nowhere
should human rights serve as a pretext for interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign States Members of the United
Nations.
The world and the United Nations have witnessed the
evolution of the political situation in my country in recent
years - in particular, since 1988. To make possible a better
understanding of the phenomena that have contributed to the
dramatic situation in Angola, allow me to provide a brief
historical overview.
50 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
The Angolan Government is ever-conscious of the
intrinsic link between peace and socio-economic
development, not just for Angola but for all of southern
Africa. My Government took the initiative of presenting a
peace programme to the then Secretary-General of the
United Nations. This programme contained the principles
that culminated in the signing of the Accords in New York
in December 1988. We recall that these accords provided
for the withdrawal of Cuban soldiers from Angola and their
return to Cuba, as well as for the withdrawal of the apartheid
forces from Angolan territory and the implementation of
Security Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning the
independence of Namibia. At that time the international
community greeted with satisfaction the New York Accords,
which opened a new era in the relations between States in
that region.
With regard to the internal conflict in Angola, the
Government was aware of the fact that only domestic peace,
achieved through dialogue and political mediation, would
make possible the creation of a favourable framework for a
solution of the conflict. Apart from its own efforts, the
Government showed that it was sensitive to African
initiatives that sought to contribute to the restoration of
peace in Angola.
Thus it was that, in the framework of the Government’s
internal peace plan, we arrived in Gbadolite in June 1989.
Unfortunately, the Accords lasted only a short time because
UNITA’s friends and allies wanted a different solution. The
failure of the Accords was due essentially to bad faith on the
part of the head of UNITA.
In spite of this failure, the Angolan Government
continued to commit itself to economic and political reforms,
as well as to a negotiated solution of the conflict. It
continued to promote genuine national reconciliation, whose
fundamental purpose was to put an end to the conflict with
UNITA.
After New York and Gbadolite, peace negotiations
continued - the Portuguese Government mediating - and the
Bicesse Accords were signed on 31 May 1991. After a
period of 18 months, during which the Angolan people lived
in relative peace, the country’s first multi-party elections
were held on 29 and 30 September 1992.
As the Assembly is aware, the United Nations
considered these elections to be to be free and fair.
UNITA was not satisfied with the defeat that the
Angolan people had inflicted on it through the ballot-box,
and once again showed its Fascist character. It did not
hesitate to take up arms again to take power by force. It
resumed its previous role as a militarist organization
incapable of conforming to democratic rules.
Jonas Savimbi’s military option plunged our country
into a civil war that has caused incalculable loss of human
lives, the destruction of social and economic infrastructure
and the displacement of millions of citizens, with such
consequences as hunger, poverty, sickness and lack of proper
clothing.
As we stated in the Security Council on 15 September
1993, the situation in Angola is exceptionally tragic and
requires special attention from the international community.
Daily, thousands of people die as a direct or indirect
consequence of the war. Children, elderly people and
women are direct victims of these acts of war. We can
declare, without fear of contradiction, that the critical
economic and political situation in Angola today bears no
similarity whatever to the situation in Somalia, Bosnia,
Cambodia or any of the republics of the former Soviet
Union. It is our profound hope that peace will be restored
to those regions.
The international community seems insensitive to our
tragedy. It is as if the Angolan people were paying the price
for playing the democratic game. Indeed, how are we to
understand the curtain of silence that envelops my country?
A poor loser will not hesitate to defy the international
community with impunity unless it punishes him once and
for all. How can one explain that UNITA still maintains
offices in certain democratic countries and that some of its
officials are still received with great pomp by officials who
do not hide their aversion to totalitarianism and are the most
ardent defenders of human rights?
On behalf of the Government of the Republic of
Angola and of its martyred people, who are dying daily by
the thousands, I appeal to the United Nations and the
international community from this rostrum to help my people
and compel the UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, once and for
all to abandon his military adventurism and respect the will
of the Angolan people, as freely expressed at the ballot
boxes in September 1992.
Speaking to the Security Council last week during its
consideration of the evolving situation in Angola, we asked
ourselves how long that great organ, responsible for
international peace and security, would permit the leader of
UNITA to perpetrate with impunity heinous massacres that
Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 51
shock the human conscience. These acts discredit and
dishonour the United Nations itself and the Security Council,
whose resolutions have been purely and simply ignored. We
would like to remind this Assembly that since the beginning
of the war in Angola in October 1992 the Security Council
has adopted 10 resolutions condemning UNITA and
demanding that it abandon the military option and resume
dialogue aimed at restoring peace.
Yet UNITA has met neither demand. Worse yet, in
reaction to Security Council resolution 864 (1993) of 15
September 1993, which provides for the imposition of
sanctions, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi attempted once
again to dupe international public opinion and the Security
Council by declaring a false cease-fire and stipulating
conditions at variance with the spirit and letter of the
Bicesse Accords, the Abidjan Protocol and the electoral
results.
The truth, however, is quite different. Not only was the
unilateral cease-fire declared by UNITA not respected, but
we witnessed an increase in military operations throughout
our national territory. As a result, fighting in Kuito and
other regions has recently intensified in a desperate UNITA
attempt to reoccupy new areas and consolidate its position.
Moreover, by making new proposals outside the negotiating
framework, Savimbi revealed his obvious intention to ignore
the resolutions of the Security Council and seize power for
himself at any cost, including the death of hundreds of
thousands more Angolans. Savimbi does not want peace
without power. Savimbi only wishes to gain time.
Obviously, the Government of Angola cannot accept the
policy of fait accompli that UNITA wishes to implement by
proposing a cease-fire in situ. We believe that there is no
good will on UNITA’s part and that it does not wish to
establish dialogue to put a definitive end to the war. This
armed party is plotting a dangerous manoeuvre with the aim
of shirking its obligation to fulfil the Bicesse Accords and
the resolutions of the Security Council.
The United Nations has a great responsibility in the
Angolan process and must not be complacent as regards
UNITA. It is important that the prestige of this Organization
in the peaceful settlement of the conflict not be jeopardized
or challenged by the irreverence of the leader of a rebel
political organization. The Government of Angola, the
United Nations and the troika of observers of the Angolan
peace process have all fallen victim in succession to
UNITA’s bad faith over the past 12 months, a bad faith that
has characterized the behaviour of Mr. Savimbi in every
meeting held since the Namibe, Addis Ababa and Abidjan
meetings.
In Abidjan the Angolan Government bent over
backwards to be flexible. In spite of the involvement of the
United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative
and of the leaders of the delegations of the observer States,
UNITA did not sign the Protocol of Understanding which
was negotiated and agreed upon to lead to the establishment
of a complete cease-fire in Angola. We would like to point
out that President Houphouët-Boigny and his Minister of
Foreign Affairs have done their best in the search for a just
solution to the Angolan conflict. These efforts have not
been successful, due solely to the obstinacy of Mr. Savimbi,
who says ""Yes"" one day and ""No"" the next.
We therefore consider that it is crucial that the
international community identify the transgressor and move
vigorously against him in Angola in an act of justice towards
our people and Government, so that our hopes for the
establishment of democracy will not be frustrated in the
midst of the transitional process currently taking place
throughout the world. We want a lasting peace based on
viable conditions for reconciling all Angolans.
In that context, my Government proposed, on 22
September 1993, the following conditions to resolve the
post-electoral crisis caused by UNITA.
First, UNITA must withdraw its military forces from
the areas they occupied illegally following the multi-party
elections held on 29 and 30 September 1992, and must then
observe the cease-fire under the terms of Security Council
851 (1993) of 15 July 1993.
Secondly, after the declaration of a cease-fire,
humanitarian assistance should be implemented and the
urgent evacuation of the wounded, sick, interested persons
and foreigners accomplished.
Thirdly, UNITA must accept fully and unequivocally
the validity of the Bicesse Accords and the results of the
election held in September 1992.
Fourthly, UNITA must respect the legislation produced
by the instruments of sovereignty established by the
elections.
The Angolan Government reiterates its willingness to
resume negotiations as soon as the conditions for those
negotiations have been established.
52 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
In my statement to the Security Council on 15
September 1993 I alerted its members to the crimes
committed by UNITA against defenceless civilian
populations. These crimes range from the cold-blooded
murder of medical personnel and hospital patients, and the
hunting down and physical elimination of journalists, family
members of Government officials and UNITA dissidents to
the bombardment of cities by long-range guns and missiles.
I also had the opportunity to discuss the situation prevailing
in some regions of Angola, where, as in Kuito, the
population has had to eat the flesh of human corpses in
order to survive. UNITA has encircled Kuito for more than
eight months and does not allow humanitarian assistance to
be distributed to the population or allow foreigners to leave
the areas in which they found themselves when the war
resumed.
In Somalia, one warlord, General Mohammed Aidid,
has been labelled an undesirable person by the United
Nations. An international arrest warrant was issued for that
Somali leader. Several days ago the General Assembly
elected a group of international jurists whose mandate is to
judge those accused of war crimes allegedly committed in
the former Yugoslavia. And what is to be said of Jonas
Savimbi?
Are the crimes that are being committed in Angola
under Mr. Savimbi’s order not worse than those which the
United Nations has attributed to General Aidid or the crimes
that it intends to judge in the former Yugoslavia? The
murder of medical personnel and patients in hospitals; the
hunting down and execution of journalists; family members
of Government leaders and dissidents from UNITA, Jonas
Savimbi’s organization; the incineration of political
adversaries in huge bonfires; the indiscriminate
bombardment of cities with long-range guns and missiles;
and UNITA’s ties with the forces of apartheid - what does
all this mean? Are these not crimes against humanity?
The sanctions that the Security Council decreed and
which entered into force on 25 September constitute proof
of the commitment of the international community to the
Angolan conflict. We hope that these signs will be
honoured by Mr. Savimbi and his allies so that dialogue can
be resumed as soon as possible, on the basis of the Bicesse
Accords, the Abidjan Protocol and on fulfilment of
paragraphs 6 and 12 of Security Council resolution 851
(1993).
In conclusion, I should like once again, on behalf of the
Government of the Republic of Angola, to express our
profound gratitude for the wide range of support the
international community has provided to alleviate the
suffering of our people. We hope this assistance will
continue in an even more substantial way. We wish to pay
here a special debt of gratitude to the humanitarian
organizations and in particular the World Food Programme,
which, in spite of UNITA’s irresponsible and criminal
actions, has continued its operations, risking the lives of its
own personnel.
We express also our gratitude to the countries that in
diverse ways have given humanitarian assistance to the
people, who still are in need of it now.
Once again, I wish the President every success in the
work of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly
and hope that its results will contribute to the strengthening
of international peace and cooperation.
"
AGO,1988,"﻿
On behalf of my Government I wish to express to you, Sir, our appreciation and satisfaction at your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We are sure that your talent and experience, as a politician and as a diplomat, will enable you to make a great contribution to the success of this session. Your election is a recognition of the importance of this factor and, at the same time, a well-deserved tribute to the country you represent. We therefore offer you our very best wishes for success in the difficult task entrusted to you.
We also wish to express our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, for the exemplary and brilliant manner in which he presided over the forty-second session, thus, making a contribution to the strengthening of the United Nations.
To the Secretary-General, Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, we pay sincere tribute for everything he has done in the cause of peace and prosperity for all mankind, in spite of the political and economic obstacles and other drawbacks faced by the Organisation today. We are sure that, with help from all of us and support for the diplomatic and political commitment he has always demonstrated, there will be hope for a lessening of tension throughout the world and for the achievement of the  peace that now begins to shimmer in the distance and will ultimately bring great joy to you all. In the international situation there are signs of hope for lessened tension and for the peace so anxiously awaited by all mankind.
The Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty), now ratified, the progress made in the field of disarmament, in the framework of the talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, the search for a negotiated settlement of the different conflicts that have been proliferating around the world - all of these are important landmarks on the way to achieving the fundamental goal of the United Nations, which needs to be pursued both in qualitative and in quantitative terms. We believe that those achievements are part of the solution to the problems that all mankind is facing today.
The radical changes we are witnessing today in the political situation in southern Africa are a consequence of a change in the balance of power, which now favours the peoples of the region engaged in a struggle against the hideous racist regime of South Africa. That is reflected in successive South African military defeats at the hands of the Angolan army and in the intensification of the liberation struggles of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa.
Acknowledgement of those facts, plus the military defeat inflicted on the racist South African forces at Cuito Cuanavale, led the Pretoria Government to sit down at the negotiating table with the Governments of Angola and Cuba, with the mediation of the United States of America, to negotiate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the establishment of peace and security in our country.
The Governments of Angola and Cuba, which have demonstrated a true spirit of integrity and flexibility throughout the talks, brought to the negotiating table a set of principles set out in a negotiating platform presented in 1984 by Comrade President José Eduardo dos Santos to the Secretary-General. As that platform is well known to all, I shall not dwell on it here.
The Government of the People's Republic of Angola has never accepted and will never accept the fictitious link some have sought to establish between the presence of Cuban internationalist troops in our territory and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978),on the independence of Namibia. It is a prerequisite for the achievement of a just, lasting and honourable peace in southern Africa  that the goals set in the negotiating platform be attained.
Attempts to establish a parallel between the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist troops and the independence of Namibia prove the arrogance and bad faith of a regime that is defying the entire international community, that continues to trample on the most fundamental rights of its own people by imposing the inhuman apartheid system, which is blocking the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence, and that pursues a systematic policy of aggression and destabilisation against the front-line States.
I am obliged to reiterate that Cuban internationalist troops are in Angola at the invitation of the Angolan Government, in keeping with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, while South African troops occupy the Territory of Namibia illegally, in violation of the relevant United Nations resolutions.
The Governments of Angola and Cuba, wishing to help resolve the problems of south-western Africa, also brought to the negotiating table a specific timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist troops from Angola, with a view to facilitating the implementation of Security Council 435 (1978), on the independence of Namibia. But it must be made perfectly clear that this gesture in no way implies de jure or de facto acceptance of the policy of ""linkage"". It should be understood, rather, as one more contribution by our Governments towards the achievement of peace in Angola and of independence for Namibia.
Angola's firm commitment in this regard and our efforts to initiate a peace process are well known.
Several meetings held in Luanda and Cape Verde were followed by a series of peace talks in London, Cairo, Now York, Geneva and Brazzaville. A protocol was signed in Geneva regulating the withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory as provided for in Security Council resolution 602 (1967); there was also agreement on the cessation of hostilities along Angola's southern border, and the installation of border control posts jointly monitored by Angola, Cuba and South Africa. That, along with the designation of 1 November as the date for initiating implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the presence of a United Nations technical tea, in Namibia/ are the clear results of the quadripartite talks. This shows how important and necessary it is for us to proceed with dialogue in order ensure peace and security in southern Africa. As President José Eduardo dos Santos pointed out in a recent statement at the Franceville summit
""Our intention is to make the peace process in southern Africa irreversible, and we shall do everything in our power to make that happen.""
Should South Africa and its allies persist in their obstinate policy of hindering the peace process by making demands which by their very nature constitute crude interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola - demands that we can never accept - history will in due course be the judge of their actions.
The Angolan Government has repeatedly declared that/ under its policy of clemency and national harmonisation/ all Angolans are entitled to free themselves from the domination of foreign interests and to integrate themselves into the society we are in the process of building. That policy, recently reiterated by the President of the People's Republic of Angola, aims at the implementation of a peace process inside Angola, a process that draws on the history and experience of other African countries which have experienced similar situations. Assurances regarding the implementation of such a process after the Brazzaville quadripartite talks were given by the highest Angolan authorities at the Franceville summit on 5 October.
The People's Republic of Angola considers that there has been much progress in the quadripartite talks. But this does not mean we can decrease our vigilance; we must rather increase our solidarity with and our unwavering support for all peoples of the southern African region and all liberation movements struggling against colonialism and apartheid. 
It is important to stress that the important consultations held at New York between Angola, Cuba and South Africa, with the mediation of the United States, were essentially exploratory in nature. Contrary to reports in the international media, their purpose was to prepare for the signing of a subsequent formal agreement. There is still a long way to go. At stake are the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola.
I must mention here the efforts of the People's Republic of the Congo, and particularly of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, towards success in the quadripartite talks.
My Government will never shirk its duty to extend all necessary support to the fraternal people of Namibia in its just struggle for independence, under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative, the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO).
Together with a21 other peace-loving peoples, the Angolan people continue to extend all possible support to the heroic people of South Africa, which, under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other patriotic forces, is struggling against the inhuman apartheid system. We take this opportunity to call upon Pretoria's allies to cease forthwith all co-operation with the inhuman regime and to impose the comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa for which the international community at large has been calling for so long.
The development in the Maghreb region give us some reason to hope that, should all parties co-operate fully with the Secretary-General and with the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), a just, lasting and politically acceptable settlement of the conflict will be found on the basis of OAU resolution 104 and relevant General Assembly resolutions. We reaffirm our total support for the Sahraoui people and for the POLISARIO Front, and we call upon the parties to the conflict to do all they can to pursue the path of dialogue. 
We welcome the agreement signed by Ethiopia and Somalia and regard them as a positive step towards improving relations between those two countries, whose common wish is to live in a climate of peace in order to be able to overcome their underdevelopment and raise the living standards of their respective peoples. We hope that the dialogue that has now been initiated between Ethiopia and Sudan - two countries whose peoples are linked by economic, historical and geographical ties - will lead to the establishment of a climate of confidence and good-neighbourliness.
As Africans, we have justified pride in welcoming the initiation of dialogue between Libya and Chad, two African countries that, under the aegis of the Organisation of African Unity, have been able to prove that it is possible to substitute dialogue for the force of arms in the settlement of regional conflicts.
We once again feel obliged to associate ourselves with all those who have demanded that the Zionist regime of Israel withdraw unconditionally from all Palestinian and other Arab territories which it is illegally occupying and where it is engaging in the most inhuman atrocities against the Arab peoples. We associate ourselves also with the international demand for the convening as soon as possible of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the sole end legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).
A major development to which special reference must be made - because of its importance for peace in the Persian Gulf - is, without any doubt, the cease-fire and the resulting talks now taking place between Iran and Iraq, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, with a view to bringing peace to those two countries that have been fighting each other for eight years now. We call upon these two fraternal countries to pursue the path of dialogue and refrain from any act that may hinder the process now under way. 
We welcome the signing of the Geneva agreement· between Pakistan and Afghanistan and hope that this will help to establish a climate of peace and security in the region.
With respect to the Kampuchean question, we believe it imperative to seek a political settlement that can contribute to the establishment of peace and stability in South-West Asia. We appreciate the promising results of the meeting held in July this year in Jakarta, Indonesia, at which the parties to this regional conflict showed optimism about the possibility of settling it. In this connection, we hail the positive attitude of the Vietnamese Government, which, in keeping with the goal of contributing to the establishment of peace in the region, has decided to withdraw before the end of this year a part of its Military contingent stationed in Kampuchea.
We are also continuing to pay special attention to the situation in the Korean peninsula and to the Korean people's efforts to bring about an independent, reunified nation. We once again express our total support for the proposals made by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea that the Korean people be enabled to decide their future without interference or foreign intervention.
To the East Timor people fighting against foreign occupation and for self-determination and independence, under the leadership of their revolutionary FRETILIN, we once again affirm our unwavering support. Furthermore, we take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the stance that the Portuguese Government has been taking in its capacity as the legal administering Power of the Territory of East Timor. In this connection, we call on that Government as well as on the Secretary-General to continue their efforts to find a just and permanent settlement of the question, in the framework of General Assembly resolution 37/30. 
Central America remains one of the regions of the earth most affected by instability. There, the policies of intervention, aggression, blackmail and interference in the internal affairs of the States concerned represent a threat to their sovereignty and development and to international peace and security. The People's Republic of Angola believes that this line of conduct is incompatible with a wish to see fewer regional conflicts and to achieve a political settlement of the differences. We therefore cannot agree that these confrontations should be viewed as ideological or as an East-West conflict.
Nicaragua and Panama are clear examples of that situation. They are currently the victims of coercive political and economic measures. We wish to reaffirm the importance and validity of the Esquipulas II peace plan and also the need for compliance by all parties with the Panama Canal Treaty.
We also express again our unwavering support for the Government and fraternal people of Cuba and their legitimate claim to regain the illegally occupied Guantanamo Naval Base from the United States and to be compensated for the material damage resulting from the occupation.
We unequivocally support General Assembly resolutions 41/11 of 27 October 1986 and 42/16 of 10 November 1987, which declare the southern Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation. We call on the States of the region to contribute to that end by Adopting measures designed to achieve the objectives of the Declaration.
We are all in favour of détente, dialogue and co-operation between States, regardless of their political or ideological differences or their stages of development. We believe also that the acme race, particularly when it involves nuclear weapons, makes the establishment of a programme for general and complete disarmament urgent. The resources used by the armaments industry could be channelled to the developing countries that are the victims of the constantly deteriorating world economic situation. 
We are sow approaching the end of yet another decade in which there has been a series of political convulsion in almost every region of the world. That is a source of great concern to the international community as a whole. During this period, some countries have been able to take important steps forward in seeking solutions to the various economic problems they face. However, despite their efforts, the majority of these countries have not succeeded in achieving anything more than a palliative that has not met their expectation for the settlement of certain problems that could really have been solved, to a large extent, with the political will and help of other countries.
As I have just said, we are approaching the end of another decade. At the beginning of this decade we had hoped for better results for mankind as a whole. It is therefore distressing to note that, despite the efforts made, the world economic situation is constantly deteriorating. The current crisis in the world economic system, which is obsolete and unjust, claims its principal victims in the developing countries. It is against that background, therefore, that we believe it to be important, indeed urgent, to establish a new international economic order that is real, fair, equitable and capable of responding to the growing concerns of more than two thirds of the human race.
At the beginning of this decade the United Nations adopted resolution 35/56 establishing a strategy by means of which the developing countries could achieve a growth rate of 7 per cent within the framework of the International Development Strategy. To that end, it was agreed also that the developed countries should contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for the benefit of the developing countries in general, and 1 per cent for the benefit of the least developed countries. Today, eight years have passed and we are still facing a manifest lack of political will on the part of cone developed countries to apply  the principles agreed upon. The consequences of this have been the stagnation in, and the reduction in the growth rates of, the majority of the developing countries.
We believe that the existing gap between our two groups of countries is constantly increasing rather than narrowing, despite the measures taken each year by the majority of those countries to bring about economic recovery. In that connection, we reaffirm our complete support for the recent decisions taken and the positions held by the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement. We are sure that they constitute the basis for future negotiations between the North and the South, taking into account the need for the revitalised, closer and fairer co-operation between the two groups of countries that which we believe is imperative.
We wish to focus for a moment on some questions that are of the greatest concern to us and that, in our opinion, are among the major impediments to the development of our countries. First, I wish to say that the international monetary and financial system will not be able to operate smoothly unless ell countries share the responsibility for the settlement of the problems relating to the malfunctioning of that system's institutions and mechanisms. Otherwise we shall continue to witness en uncontrolled flow of our resources to the developed countries. These resources could be utilised for the economic development of the countries of the South.  
There is therefore an urgent need for the restructuring of the present international monetary and financial system so as to render it more viable and capable of securing wider and more just world co-operation. Today a problem of undeniable importance is the inordinate level of the debt of the developing countries, which reached the astronomical figure of $1,200 billion in 1987. We therefore deem it appropriate to appeal to the multilateral financial institutions and the creditor countries to review, together with us, the impracticability of the mechanisms of the international monetary system now in force. 
We reaffirm once again the need for an international meeting to be held as soon as possible on the debt of the developing countries, to enable debtors and creditors together to work out a solution to this thorny issue. For the low-growth countries of the African continent, the debt situation has become critical. The continued drop in prices of commodities, the main exports of the African countries, is an insurmountable obstacle to both their participation in the world economy and the effective implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, which are essential pre-conditions for real recovery in their economies. We accordingly endorse the position of African Heads of State at the OAU summit meeting in December 1987 on the convening of an international conference on external debt in Africa. The economic crisis has seriously affected the developing countries capacity to take a more active part in international trade. The economies of those countries are concentrated on the export of one or a few commodities or manufactures, and at the same time those products suffer from instability in developed countries and are the victim of protectionist measures on the part of the market-economy countries - measures that are in flagrant violation of the rules and principles of international trade and incompatible with the commitments undertaken by those countries in various international bodies. We must therefore continue to concentrate our efforts on achieving real adjustment in the structure of international trade and implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The People's Republic of Angola is convinced that the international community can create the condition necessary for this to be close. 
The interdependence of States, of which we are totally aware, should lead us to a greater sensitivity concerning the food crisis. We note with deep regret the deterioration in the food and agriculture situation in many developing countries, especially African countries, which are experiencing a serious food deficit. The international community should support more strongly the International Fund for Agricultural Development in order to enable it to embark upon its second decade on a better and more solid financial footing. 
The People's Republic of Angola, a developing country which has never experienced a single day of peace since it achieved independence in November 1975, is an integral part of the international community and cannot remain silent with regard to the world in general or the problems of the underdeveloped countries in particular. Its contribution to minimising the countless economic and social problems affecting mankind is still very weak. 
We have been making efforts, together with others, to achieve the just peace so badly needed by the heroic Angolan people to solve the economic problems we continue to experience.' In this connection my Government has taken certain measures within the framework of the Economic and Financial Recovery Programme and has been enacting legislation that will make its implementation possible. 
I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to increase its support and programmes of assistance for the People's Republic of Angola with a view to helping repair the damage caused by the war of aggression and destabilisation waged by South Africa. This damage, in material terms - equipment, highways, bridges, roads, railroads and so forth - amounts to more than $12 billion, cost the lives of more than 50,000 people, caused the displacement of 200,000 families and created close to 150,000 refugees.
In conclusion, Mr. President, allow me to reiterate our sincere wishes for your complete success in conducting the proceedings of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and to assure you of the fullest co-operation of the Angolan delegation whenever necessary and at all times.
The struggle continues. Victory is certain.
"
AGO,2012,"﻿On behalf
of the Government of the Republic of Angola, I avail
myself of this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Vuk
Jeremić on his election to preside over the General
Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and to assure him
of the support of my country in the fulfilment of his
mission. It is our belief that under his leadership this
session will confirm the importance and role of the General Assembly in finding solutions to the burning
issues affecting humankind, thereby helping to make
the world safer and fairer. I would also like to express
our gratitude to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for
the exemplary and wise manner in which he conducted
the work of the Assembly at its previous session. I
further salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for
the dynamism he has invested in the work of our
Organization. In this connection, I would like to thank
him for his visit to my country in February of this
year, during the celebration of the tenth anniversary
of the advent of peace in Angola. During that visit,
he had the opportunity to familiarize himself with the
progress made in the reconstruction of the country and
consolidation of democratic institutions.
This session of the General Assembly is taking place
at a time of profound international political, economic
and social transformations, which reaffirm the relevance
of the central theme of our discussion: maintaining
international peace and security, eradicating poverty,
promoting development, protecting the environment
and ensuring a better future for generations to come,
guaranteeing the rule of law in international relations,
and promoting and ensuring the protection of human
rights. These are indeed the main challenges facing us
today.
In addition to these, there are further challenges
requiring priority attention from our Organization,
including disarmament, the fight against organized
crime, the implementation of the Global Counter-
Terrorism Strategy, and the persistence of armed
conflicts and their impact on people’s lives. Having
had the painful experience of war, which still has
major consequences for the lives of our people, Angola
reiterates that dialogue and negotiation are the way to
a peaceful resolution of conflict. Angola will continue
to meet its obligations and fulfil its responsibilities
at the international level, in particular with regard
to Africa as a whole, as well as in the context of the
regional economic and political groups to which it
belongs, including the Southern African Development
Community, the Community of Portuguese-speaking
Countries, the Economic Community of Central
African States and the International Conference of the
Great Lakes Region.
The international economic and financial crisis
that is affecting all countries in the world continues
to demand solutions, including the reform of the
economic, financial and international trade system in order to serve the interests of all countries in a global
perspective. In this regard, my Government reiterates
its support for initiatives aimed at liberalizing
international trade in line with the Doha Round. The
reform of the international economic and financial
system’s regulatory institutions is of crucial importance
to ensure greater flexibility and transparency in
allocating capital to the least developed countries — a
category that includes the majority of African nations.
It is also essential to take appropriate measures
towards strengthened support for international action
on sustainable development and increased financial
contributions to the United Nations to enable our
Organization to fulfil its mandate efficiently. It must
do so by renewing its commitments to the sustainable
development issues contained in Agenda 21, adopted
at the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The United
Nations Conference on Sustainable Development
provided a solid framework for creating national and
international policies to ensure the social, economic
and environmental welfare of our peoples.
We note that despite the progress made, there is
a continued need for the international community to
translate commitments into action in order to achieve
sustainable development. Africa in general, and my
country in particular, believe that intensive efforts on
the part of the international community are needed to
tackle the phenomena that threaten to reverse progress
made with respect to development. Drought and
desertification, climate change, natural disasters, loss
of biodiversity and rapid urbanization are just some of
the factors that adversely affect development efforts
worldwide.
The Security Council plays a key role in preventing
and resolving conflicts, and in peacekeeping efforts, in
accordance with the powers conferred upon it by the
Charter of the United Nations. The central theme at
the heart of our debate calls for reform of the Security
Council, as well as ensuring the fair representation
of all regions and the broadening of its permanent
membership in order to adapt it to contemporary reality.
Allow me to refer to a set of conflicts that are of
critical concern to my country. In the Great Lakes
region, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo continues to worry the international community.
My country reaffirms its support for the decisions of
the third extraordinary summit of the International
Conference on the Great Lakes Region, held in Kampala, as well as the efforts of the African Union
and the Southern African Development Community.
Angola welcomes the normalization of the legal
and constitutional order in Somalia as a result of the
completion of the transition process, including the
inauguration of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.
Given that the situation remains unstable, Angola urges
the international community to continue to support the
stabilization process in that country.
The situation in the Sudan has seen positive
developments. Angola welcomes the recent agreements
between the sisterly Republics of South Sudan and the
Sudan, with a view to the settling of their disputes.
Angola urges stakeholders to engage with one another
and to show the political will necessary to implement
the commitments undertaken.
With respect to Mali, Angola deplores the
worsening humanitarian situation resulting from
the crisis prevailing in that country. Angola calls
upon the international community to demonstrate its
determination to preserve the unity, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Mali.
In the sisterly nation of Guinea-Bissau, we
advocate a comprehensive solution and the permanent
normalization of the constitutional order, in accordance
with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the
African Union, the Community of Portuguese-speaking
Countries and the Economic Community of West
African States, as well as the wishes of all the internal
actors, in order to stabilize the country and establish
peace.
We remain concerned about the lack of progress
in resolving the issue of Western Sahara. We call on
the parties involved to continue negotiations under
the auspices of the United Nations so that the people
of Western Sahara can exercise their right of self-
determination.
The prevailing situation in the Middle East in
general, and the Palestinian territories in particular,
is one of the most serious problems facing the
international community. Angola supports the creation
of an independent Palestinian State living side by side
with the State of Israel in peace and security and within
secure internationally recognized borders, in line with
the position of the international community.
The conflict in Syria poses a grave threat to
international peace and security and will seriously exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the region.
Angola urges the international community to support
the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special
Representative of the United Nations and the League
of Arab States for Syria, to seek a negotiated solution
to the conflict.
The embargo imposed on Cuba violates international
law and for decades has been a major impediment to that
country’s development and improvements in the lives
of its citizens. Angola reiterates its principled position
affirming the need to end the embargo in accordance
with the relevant United Nations resolutions.
Angola’s foreign policy will continue to be based on
mutual respect, mutual benefit, good-neighbourliness
and the strengthening of regional economic integration.
Angola will continue to comply with all the international
commitments and international instruments to which it
is a party.
Ten years after achieving peace, Angola has
recorded significant progress in consolidating its
democratic process. General elections were held on
31 August in a civil and peaceful atmosphere, thus
demonstrating the maturity of its people. The results
expressed the sovereign will of the Angolan people,
as verified by international observers who closely
followed the election.
Currently, Angola is joyfully celebrating the
investiture of its organs of State sovereignty, including
the President of the Republic and the National Assembly,
as well as the assumption of office by members of the
Government. It is experiencing a dynamic reconstruction
and development process marked by the consolidation
of macroeconomic stability that has had positive
effects on the stabilization of the national currency.
In addition, the rehabilitation and modernization of
major productive and social infrastructure, namely
the reconstruction of roads, railways, electricity
supply and distribution systems, water supply systems
and sanitation and telecommunication networks, are
contributing to the progressive improvement of the
living conditions of Angolans.
Political stability and the strengthening of
institutional capacity have enabled the Angolan
economy to grow at an average rate of 9.2 per cent over
the past five years, while the non-oil sector has grown
at an average rate of 12 per cent. Those growth rates
were due to effective measures by the Government
aimed at stabilizing the fiscal, monetary and currency macroeconomic indicators and thereby facilitating the
revival of the economy.
The fi ght against hunger and the struggle to reduce
and eradicate poverty are two of the biggest challenges
being addressed by the Angolan State owing to their
impact on people’s lives. Indeed, their resolution is
crucial if we are to build a more prosperous society and
achieve social justice.
Despite Angola’s successes in the last decade,
it was not possible to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals as we had wished. However, the
country’s macroeconomic development indicators have
permitted the Committee for Development Policy of
the Economic and Social Council to consider Angola
eligible to graduate from its least developed country
status starting in 2015.
On behalf of the Angolan Government, we would
like to express our gratitude for the trust that investors have shown in us and for the assistance provided by
international partners which, added to investment from
national sources, has allowed us to achieve the level of
economic growth the country has been experiencing.
We are aware that there is still much to do to ensure
that the high growth rates the country has seen in the
recent past are reflected in an effective, systematic and
gradual increase in the standard of living of the Angolan
people, through a better distribution of national income
and higher employment levels, especially among youth,
and increased and better investment in the area of social
welfare.
In conclusion, I must reiterate Angola’s commitment
to the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter
of the United Nations and state that we will continue
to engage in the search for solutions to the challenges
facing the international community."
AGO,2015,"At the outset, on behalf of the President of Angola, Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, the outgoing President, on the capable manner in which he led the work of the Assembly at the sixty-ninth session. In addition, I commend the Secretary-General for his continued commitment to finding solutions to the complex issues that trouble the international community.
The objective of the San Francisco Conference was to build a world based on international law and to seek peaceful solutions to international disputes. Over the course of 70 years, we have seen progress and setbacks. Remarkable progress has been made in the area of decolonization, which is reflected in the number of countries that now constitute the United Nations family. However, there has been no success with regard to collective security, an issue that led to the creation of the United Nations and that remains at the heart of its concerns. We must reflect together on the role and future of the United Nations. We need an Organization capable of promoting peace and international security, of acting quickly and effectively in conflict situations, and of addressing current and emerging challenges.
By adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), States Members of the United Nations reaffirmed as absolute priorities the eradication of poverty and hunger, the promotion of social and economic development, the protection of the rights of all, gender equality, women’s empowerment, the environment, access to quality services and special attention to vulnerable groups.
The 2030 Agenda reasserts the principle of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development that it is possible to promote global and sustainable development and establishes universal Goals that highlight the need for cooperation among peoples and a common path for humankind. It calls for a global partnership and for commitments from all parties to mitigating the adverse consequences of climate change, eradicating poverty and extreme poverty, and creating opportunities for all. I reiterate
Angola’s commitment to taking appropriate measures to strengthen the Organization’s development agenda.
In the near future, the United Nations will also be involved in the review of three very important processes: women and peace and security, peacekeeping operations and the peacebuilding architecture.
As I stated before, the ideal that guided the creation of the United Nations 70 years ago — to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war — has not yet been achieved. People around the world expect the leaders of the 193 nations represented here to join in a collective effort to find appropriate solutions to the serious and multiple challenges that the people of the world face. As we commemorate this anniversary, we bear in mind the role and responsibilities of the United Nations as the pre-eminent forum for finding solutions to international problems, preserving peace, strengthening collective security and renouncing the use of force in international relations, respecting the sovereignty of States, defending and promoting human rights and reaffirming the rule of law as a fundamental principle of the international system.
This occasion should provide an additional incentive to accelerate reforms aimed at revitalizing the United Nations system, in particular the Security Council, by extending the number of its permanent and non-permanent members, thereby making this body more representative and better equipped to address the challenges and opportunities that the world faces. Angola reaffirms the right of the African continent to be represented among the permanent members of the Security Council.
The forced displacement of thousands of human beings presents a heartbreaking picture of human degradation that offends human dignity. It requires an immediate and comprehensive response by the international community.
In the coming month of November, Angola will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of its national independence in an environment of peace, tolerance and reconciliation — a direct result of the will of the Angolan people to work together to achieve higher levels of economic growth and greater social inclusion, progress and well-being for all in a more democratic, prosperous and modern country.
Despite the adverse global environment, the Government of Angola remains committed to sustained growth. To that end, it is implementing its national
14/55 15-29658

development plan, which aims to rehabilitate and modernize economic and social infrastructure, promote public and private investment, and improve vocational and skills training and human resources management.
The rise in terrorist activities perpetrated by extremist groups in Africa and elsewhere in the world is a serious security problem and one that calls for a global coalition to combat this scourge. The creation of the Multinational Joint Task Force, involving the countries of the Lake Chad Basin and Benin, is an example of the sort of collective response that deserves the support of the international community in order to purge the African continent of the terrorism that has caused such enormous suffering to its people.
The situation in the Central African Republic remains a challenge from the point of view of political and socioeconomic stability and domestic security. Angola supports the efforts of the transitional Government to restore public order and restructure State institutions and encourages all the parties to respect the commitments made in the Bangui Forum as a fundamental prerequisite for attaining an inclusive, peaceful and transparent electoral process.
We welcome the recent compromise reached between the Government of South Sudan and the armed opposition, mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and other international partners, to resolve the crisis plaguing the country. We encourage the parties to the Agreement to honour their commitments and the international community to maintain its support for the peace process.
In Guinea-Bissau, with the institutional crisis now overcome, recent political developments augur well for economic growth and political and social stabilization. We appeal to all Guinean political and social actors to display the utmost sense of responsibility, and we urge the international community to continue to fulfil the promises made at the donors’ conference in Brussels.
The question of Western Sahara continues to concern us, in view of the need for the Saharan people to exercise their right to self-determination. We call on the parties to continue negotiations and to find a mutually acceptable solution within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant Security Council resolutions.
We are concerned about the business-as-usual mindset that prevails in the process of finding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We advocate a
resumption of negotiations leading to a lasting solution, based on two States living side by side in peace and security.
The conflicts in Libya, Syria and Iraq require fast responses, given the serious humanitarian consequences resulting from them. The causes of these conflicts lie in the serious violations of the basic rights of the people of these countries and in external interference, with attempted coups or changes of regime and the artificial imposition of democracy from outside having tragic and disastrous consequences.
Angola warmly welcomes the agreement concluded by the six Powers and the European Union with the Islamic Republic of Iran on the Iranian nuclear programme. That outcome is evidence that any dispute, however difficult and complex, may have a political solution and is particularly notable in the case of a region where diplomacy has, in recent decades, been systematically passed over.
Angola is closely following the normalization of the diplomatic relations between the United States of America and Cuba, which is a welcome development. However, Angola emphasizes the need to put an end to the economic, financial and commercial embargo against Cuba, which limits the right of the Cuban people to development and is contrary to the principles and rules of international law.
The Republic of Angola currently holds the presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and has been engaged in seeking solutions to the problems affecting the region, both bilaterally and multilaterally, as well as in the Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council. In this context, we reiterate our determination to continue to support and promote dialogue, peace, security and stability in Central Africa and throughout the Great Lakes region.
Aware of its responsibilities in an international context that is becoming increasingly fluid and complex, and aware of the security challenges that the States bordering the Gulf of Guinea face, the Angolan Government, with the support of the United States of America and Italy, will host an international conference on maritime and energy security in the coming days in Luanda in order to contribute to a response to threats of terrorism and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humankind. For this reason, adopting a protocol
15-29658 15/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
to govern the global action to protect the climate system at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is of the highest importance. This agreement should include a commitment to limiting the increase in average global temperatures to 1.5°C by the end of the century. Likewise, the new agreement must include models of sharing enabling tools to protect the right to development and strengthen resilience in developing countries.
Finally, I wish to reaffirm the importance that my country places on the role of multilateralism in solving global problems by finding realistic and bold solutions through concertation, in accordance with a logic of shared responsibilities and benefits and in fulfilment of the legitimate interests of all, We call on all Member States to renew their confidence in the ability of the United Nations to strengthen international dialogue as a key element of the culture of peace, respect for differences between peoples and conflict prevention, which are the very foundations of the progress and development to which all the peoples of the world are entitled.
"
AGO,2004,"I am
overwhelmed with a great sense of joy at seeing
Mr. Ping preside over the General Assembly at this
fifty-ninth session. My first words are thus to convey
to him, on behalf of my Government and on my own
behalf, the most heartfelt congratulations upon his
election. Our satisfaction springs from the great esteem
in which the Angolan people hold your country and
from the strong ties of friendship and fraternity that
unite us.
I would also like to congratulate your predecessor
for the dynamic manner in which he carried out his
mandate.
53

At a time when the world is confronting the
horrors of violence, poverty and hunger, the members
of the Assembly once again have the difficult
responsibility of assessing the implementation of their
decisions and of seeking new solutions to problems
that affect millions of human beings — solutions that
will require a mechanism for international cooperation.
The United Nations must remain the pivotal
instrument for States in dealing with new international
challenges to peace and security, such as terrorism;
hunger; poverty; violations of human rights that
continue to deprive millions of human beings of their
fundamental freedoms; the degradation of the
environment; organized transnational crime, including
drug trafficking; and HIV/AIDS.
The recent difficulties that the United Nations has
confronted in dealing with situations that have
seriously affected international security have exposed
the limitations of its structure and its operation. The
United Nations system must be urgently reformed and
adapted to the demands and challenges of the current
situation, which is characterized by globalization.
The main organs of the United Nations lack the
broad democratic character that they need in order to
express the will of the majority of the Members of the
Organization. Both categories of membership of the
Security Council should be expanded — on the basis of
equitable geographical representation — so as to
reflect the new international order.
In the past 50 years, humanity has made
important advances in the areas of science and
technology, economic development, medicine and
other fields, which have resulted in improved living
conditions and in an increase in the life expectancy of
vast segments of the world’s population, as well as in
the growth of the world’s material and even spiritual
wealth.
However, while some countries and continents
have shared in those gains, others continue to be
marginalized — overwhelmed by economic setbacks
that force a significant part of their population to live
below the poverty line.
The aspirations of such people to a world of
social justice and the full exercise of their economic
and social rights, including the right to development,
continue to be unfulfilled. In fact, the ranks of the poor
have not stopped growing: since 1990, the number of
poor people has been growing in sub-Saharan Africa,
Southern Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean.
In the recent summit on hunger and poverty,
promoted by the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva,
world leaders highlighted the dramatic situation of
billions of human beings living mainly in developing
countries who are suffering from hunger, malnutrition
and diseases that are easily preventable.
This is a reprehensible picture, and we must
therefore make the eradication of hunger and poverty a
priority in our national policies and on the
Organization’s agenda. This dramatic situation could
rapidly be reversed by a greater commitment on the
part of the Governments of developing countries and a
stronger political will on the part of the richest
countries.
Furthermore, restrictions on international free
trade have contributed to a deterioration in the living
conditions of people in countries subjected to
restrictive economic measures, as is the case in Cuba.
We believe that such measures constitute an assault on
moral and humanitarian principles.
In spite of the efforts made by developing nations
to improve their economic performance and the
well-being of their populations, the practical results do
not measure up to the needs of the development
process. This is partly the result of the imposition on
developing countries of policies that do not take their
realities into account.
Some institutions and rich countries are
pressuring poor countries to follow the steps taken by
industrialized countries during their economic
development, alleging that developing countries will
develop faster because of the benefits resulting from
the implementation of policies that have in the past
yielded positive results.
Such guidelines do not come close to meeting the
development needs of poor countries. They fail to
place an emphasis on training institutions at the local
and national level; those institutions should, indeed,
serve as levers for development.
Wealthy nations have a moral responsibility to
foster a spirit of partnership, not of inequality and
dependence, so as to contribute to the development of
the less affluent countries and to the establishment of
institutions capable of sustaining their integration into
the global economy.
54

The existing economic disparities between the
wealthy countries of the North and the developing
countries of the South is not the result of choice on the
part of the latter. The enrichment of the industrialized
world has been achieved at the expense of the
impoverishment of the Third World through the
rampant exploitation of its natural resources and
workforce and the imposition of a system of
occupation and dominance.
Today, our countries and peoples are still
suffering as a result of those policies of exploitation
and subjugation, which in some cases have been
worsened by internal conflicts that came about after the
end of the period of foreign dominance.
It appears to us at times that the international
financial institutions and the rich countries deliberately
minimize those facts. From our point of view, the
extensive hesitation with respect to financial assistance
to developing countries is unjustified. Furthermore,
some of the imposed preconditions seem to be a
response more to political interests rather than to the
requirements of sustainable economic development.
We had until recently called on this body and on
the international community to support the restoration
of peace in Angola. That long-sought peace has finally
arrived and it has proved to be irreversible.
The success of the peace process ushered in a
new phase: the laying of the political groundwork for
the construction of a new society, one based on the rule
of law, tolerance, a market economy, and the existence
of a vibrant civil society. In addition to that political
process, my Government is engaged in economic
reform, which is a contributing factor to economic and
social stability. Were it not for the tremendous,
simultaneous challenges that we have had to face, that
process could have been faster.
So far, the Angolan Government has been
tackling alone the task of national reconstruction. That
task involves the rehabilitation of social and productive
infrastructures, which were almost totally destroyed by
the armed conflict; the social reintegration of nearly
100,000 former combatants and their families; the
resettlement of more than 4 million internally displaced
persons and more than 400,000 refugees; and a far-
reaching effort to reduce the poverty that afflicts most
of the population. This very difficult task can be
successful only with the full participation of the
international community.
The reservations expressed by certain
international donors in terms of providing assistance to
Angola — overlooking the fact that the internal
conflict was quite lengthy and destructive, that it
absorbed a large part of the country’s financial, human
and materials resources, and that it disrupted the
country — can be justified only by a lack of political
will.
The reconstruction of Angola urgently requires
partnerships and substantial support comparable to the
assistance given to other countries in post-conflict
situations.
As a country that is rejoicing in the peace and
freedom for which it fought for 40 years, Angola is
concerned with the instability in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, a country that shares an
extensive land border with Angola, and with which we
have fraternal ties. We were particularly shocked by
the massacres of civilians in Gatumba. The
perpetrators of that heinous act, who provoked a new
escalation of violence in order to make the peace
process unworkable, must be held judicially
accountable. That act makes clear, inter alia, that,
despite the significant efforts made in the context of
the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, the situation is still quite fragile.
The international community, particularly the
Security Council and the African Union, must devote
special and ongoing attention to this issue in order to
avoid a collapse of the process.
In that context, subregional organizations, the
countries of the region and other bodies involved in the
pursuit of lasting peace in that country must cooperate,
with a view to encouraging the Congolese parties to
meet their commitments under the transitional process.
It is crucial that all the countries neighbouring the
Democratic Republic of the Congo reiterate their
commitment to continue to respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the country and not to interfere
in its internal affairs.
The Transitional Government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo needs the support of the
international community. My Government is willing, to
the extent of its ability, to supply the necessary
assistance in the process of the consolidation of peace
and stability in that country.
55

The crisis in Darfur is a thorn in the international
juridical conscience. Angola supports the decision of
the Secretary-General to authorize an investigation. We
hope that the authorities of the Sudan will fully
cooperate with the African Union and the Security
Council in their efforts to help bring peace to the
people of that region. We believe that there now exists
a solid basis for resolving that conflict.
Having in the past been a victim of terrorism,
Angola cannot be indifferent to acts of terrorism,
wherever they may happen. The acts of terrorism we
have witnessed in recent times, and the vile and cruel
form they have taken, should not discourage the efforts
that the international community has been making to
root out their perpetrators, but should instead increase
its determination to isolate terrorist groups and stymie
their efforts.
We believe, however, that we should reflect
further on ways to prevent and combat terrorism. Have
the methods used to date been effective in eradicating
terrorism? Is the current system of collective security
capable of coping with the aggressiveness of the
terrorists? Would responses to terrorism based on the
multilateral efforts of the United Nations be less
effective?"
AGO,1999,"Allow me, to begin, Sir,
by congratulating you on behalf of the Government of the
Republic of Angola, and on my own behalf, on your
election as president of the General Assembly at this fifty-
fourth session. Your election to such an important post is
recognition of your experience, ability and diplomatic
capacity, as well as of Namibia’s role internationally.
Angola and Namibia not only share a long common border,
but also have close political, economic, cultural and
historical links. We sincerely hope that your mandate will
be crowned with success.
Our congratulations also go to the outgoing President,
Mr. Didier Opertti, for the excellent work carried out
during his mandate.
To the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr.
Kofi Annan, we would like also to express our thanks for
the wise and transparent manner in which he has led our
Organization.
It is also a pleasure for us to welcome the new
members of the United Nations, the Republic of Kiribati,
the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. Their
accession reflects the universal nature of the principles
and rules of the United Nations Charter. Angola is
convinced that these States will be able to successfully
take up their responsibilities, thereby contributing to the
strengthening of our Organization and the stability and
development of the South Pacific region and the world as
a whole.
For half a century, the Organization has carried out
activities to promote the ideals contained in its Charter.
With the end of the cold war we thought that large-scale
fratricidal wars would be things of the past; that the world
would no longer experience tension and insecurity; that
by now we would be in a position to welcome a
narrowing of the gap between the rich and poor countries;
that a significant part of humanity would be free from the
danger of dying of poverty and misery. However, these
things have not happened. The world is hostage to itself.
There is a plethora of new armed conflicts as a result of
hatred and racial, ethnic and religious intolerance; of the
denial of people’s right to self-determination; and even of
the unfathomable ambition of certain politicians to take
power by force or to attempt to thwart peoples’ sovereign
will to choose their own destinies.
The proliferation of armed conflicts is, to some
extent, a reflection of the absence of an international
security system under the aegis of the United Nations that
would be able to respond immediately and correctly to
potential conflicts. Despite instability in various areas of
the world, there has been a weak commitment to
establishing such a security system because of a lack of
political will on the part of certain members of the
international community. This indicates that the world is
still very far from achieving the long-desired peace and
development. Worse yet is the fact that certain entities of
international law approach the need for peace in the world
from a perspective of material and global strategic
interests — and at the expense of the universal human
values.
It weighs on our conscience to see that we still have
a long way to go to find solutions to situations of this
nature, and that the international community’s reactions
to similar situations of human suffering are not consistent.
These facts might lead us to believe that we are
dealing with a double standard and with measured
policies that are at variance with the spirit and letter of
32


the Charter of the United Nations. The United Nations and
the international community as a whole have the political,
legal and moral duty to work a little harder, so that peoples
facing the scourge of the war will be able to achieve lasting
peace. The main objective of the United Nations can be
achieved worldwide, provided that there is coherence and
determination in the application of principles and decisions.
The global tolerance of impunity has been encouraging
the leaders of the rebel groups proliferating throughout the
world to carry out their terrorist and destructive campaigns,
the main victim of which is civil society. The differential
treatment accorded to identical situations of systematic and
massive violations of human rights and the war crimes that
are occurring in some areas of the world makes it
impossible for the international justice system to act with
the required effectiveness in dealing with some of the most
barbaric and bloodthirsty criminals that Africa has seen this
century. We are convinced that if the political and moral
power of the United Nations were exerted against all the
perpetrators of serious crimes, it would dishearten all those
who might be willing to resort to subversion and terrorism.
Thus the international community would be preventing the
emergence of new conflicts.
We are fully aware that States have the primary
responsibility for paving the way for the prevention of
conflicts. The implementation of democracy, which may
promote respect for human rights and the establishment of
neighbourly relations, may be able to contribute to
preventing the occurrence of conflicts. Indeed, many of the
current crises would not have lasted long if the States
involved in them had, in good faith, fully complied with
their international obligations as set forth in the Charter of
the United Nations and as established by regional
organizations. I refer in particular to the principle of
non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. For
this reason, the mechanisms for the fulfilment of such
international obligations by States should be further
reinforced.
The Government of the Republic of Angola commends
the work undertaken by the Secretary-General regarding the
reinforcement of the preventive diplomacy mechanisms.
However, the increase in the number of wars, particularly
since 1998, leads us to conclude that the efforts in this
regard still fall short of reaching the objectives. It is thus
necessary for us to strive to create the institutional capacity
for conflict prevention, including regional early-warning
mechanisms.
Regarding conflict resolution, Angola’s experiences
force us to stress that there is an urgent need to re-define
methods and strategies, mainly in the field of
peacekeeping operations. Other factors underlying the
limited success of some peacekeeping missions carried
out under the aegis of the United Nations are: the obvious
frailty of the verification systems of peace agreements;
the tendency to treat similarly the violator and the fulfiller
of these agreements; the overlooking of early signs that
suggest a lack of political will and ill-faith by one of the
sides; and the subsequent delayed application of coercive
measures.
As a member State of the international community
we need to rely on and have recourse to the United
Nations in its important role regarding the issues of
peacekeeping and security in the world. Angola will
continue to believe that, in order to establish peace in the
world, the United Nations role is of paramount
importance. We simply want to suggest that, given the
current international situation, this role should be played
in a more realistic and effective way, with a view to
living up to the expectations of people eager for peace
and to ensuring the credibility of our Organization.
I would like now to refer to the situation in Angola,
where five years have passed since the Lusaka Protocol
was signed between the Government and UNITA.
However, the main tasks involved in attaining a lasting
peace have not yet been achieved. In particular, UNITA
has not been completely disarmed and State authority has
not been restored in the illegally occupied areas. Rather,
the persistent refusal of the rebels to fully honour their
obligations and their preference for taking power by force
have plunged the country into a new era of violence.
Following this rejection of the people’s will, as
expressed at the polls during the 1992 general elections,
and the non-fulfilment of the provisions of the three peace
accords entered into with the Government — in 1989 in
Gbadolite, in the former Zaire; in 1991 in Portugal and in
1994 in Lusaka — Mr. Savimbi is still interested in
continuing his destabilization campaign. This includes
preventing the smooth running of the democratic
institutions; destroying cities, towns, villages,
infrastructure and public and private assets; and
mercilessly killing civilians. In this way he has been
condemning to misery, disease and famine all of the
people in Angola.
As a result of these actions, in addition to the
thousands of civilians who have already been killed,
33


almost 3 million others have left their homes in search of
refuge in the Government-controlled areas. Those
communities require humanitarian assistance from the
international community. In the framework of the
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, the Government
has, in good faith, undertaken all the tasks provided for it
in the peace accords, in spite of the fact that Savimbi and
his military wing have resumed the war. The Government
continues to ensure the functioning of the democratic
institutions resulting from the general elections, and UNITA
members are represented in the Government and the
parliament.
In the national armed forces, military troops, officials
and soldiers appointed by UNITA remain faithful to the
ideals of democracy and national accord. Only Mr. Savimbi
and a fairly reduced number of qualified personnel who
remain faithful to him are still interested in making war
with a view to taking power. All of Savimbi’s propaganda
of recent years has merely been playing for time and
anticipating that developments on the international scene
might come out in his favour. His false messages on
negotiations, allowing him time to prepare the ground for
new military adventures, are elements of that strategy.
Indeed, what remains to be done in the Angolan peace
process is to enforce what was negotiated in-depth at
Lusaka over an entire year, particularly the disarming of all
of Mr. Jonas Savimbi’s military forces and the restoration
of state administration throughout the national territory. The
Angolan Government has long waited for Savimbi to decide
to opt for peace. Angola is currently facing other political
and economic challenges that cannot be indefinitely
postponed as a result of the actions of a single power-
hungry individual who considers war to be the only way to
fulfil his personal plans. Furthermore, in rejecting
Savimbi’s posture, many UNITA militants and leaders have
distanced him from the party. These women and men are
working in good faith to consolidate the Angolan
democratic process.
Given Savimbi’s obstructionist behaviour, the Security
Council decided to impose global mandatory sanctions
against UNITA, including the prohibition of international
travel for top UNITA officials directly involved in the
Angola war project. In the same vein, and as a result of the
crimes that Savimbi has been committing against the
civilian population, the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) and the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) declared him a war criminal and thus an unreliable
stakeholder in the implementation of peace in Angola. The
Non-Aligned Movement, in its ministerial meeting of 23
September 1999 held here in New York, expressed its
strong support for the resolution adopted at the recent
OAU Summit, which deems Mr. Savimbi a war criminal
and requires that he be treated as such by the entire
international community. We trust that there is no further
doubt about the criminal nature of Mr. Savimbi or the
need for him to be held responsible internationally for his
crimes and actions.
The Angolan Government reiterates its ongoing
commitment to paving the way for a lasting peace and, to
that end, to making use of all the means at its disposal,
and undertakes to proceed with the process of national
reconciliation and social democratization. A clear
demonstration of its commitment is the fact that, despite
the war climate pervading the country, at no time
whatsoever has the Government denied the rights and
individual liberties of citizens or of national legal political
forces.
In the framework of the political reforms initiated in
1991, a new constitution is being prepared in a process in
which all political parties are participating. The new
constitutional text will reinforce the rule of law and
consolidate the type of society that we intend to establish
in Angola: an economically prosperous one under
democratic rule of law and a State of social justice. In the
economic context, the reforms will follow their course
with a view to reinforcing the creation of other conditions
for an effective market economy and of a more
favourable environment for foreign investment.
In order to meet these challenges, we call for the
support and solidarity of the international community,
particularly regarding the implementation of sanctions
imposed by the Security Council against UNITA, so that
Angola can more rapidly achieve peace and consolidate
and accelerate the economic reform process.
It is our sincere hope that the new initiatives of the
Security Council, proposed by Ambassador Robert
Fowler, Chairman of the Committee on Sanctions, as well
as the support already expressed by some Governments
and international institutions, may contribute significantly
to reinforcing sanctions, dismantling the illegal diamond-
trafficking network, which is subsidizing the war carried
out by Savimbi, and bringing its perpetrators before the
court.
In tandem with its efforts to implement peace, the
Angolan Government is also committed to implementing
social-impact economic programmes and to relaunching
34


the basis for the resettlement of communities with a view
to economically rehabilitating the country. In this regard,
we wish to call upon all United Nations Member States to
support the draft resolution that Angola will submit to the
General Assembly on economic rehabilitation. In addition
to lending their support to the draft resolution, we call on
our partners particularly to participate in the economic
rehabilitation of Angola.
The disarming of anti-personal landmines is another
task that requires the ongoing involvement and support of
the international community. The Angolan Government will
remain engaged at the national, regional and international
levels in order to overcome that scourge. A clear
demonstration of this determination is the fact that we were
one of the first State parties to the Ottawa Convention on
the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and
Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.
The security, stability and territorial integrity of
Angola and its neighbours depend on the stability of the
region. We are currently facing a dangerous increase of
destabilization which, if not controlled, may seriously affect
the development of that part of the continent. Angola will
continue to lend its support, under SADC, to the
implementation of peace in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. The Ceasefire Agreement signed in Lusaka and its
complete fulfilment will pave the way for the return of
refugees and the initiation of dialogue between the
Congolese political forces, to which falls the responsibility
of deciding the destiny of their country. The United Nations
and the OAU are also called upon to play a crucial role in
the establishment of a lasting peace. It would be reasonable
for the invading countries to make a gesture by
withdrawing from Congolese territory and ceasing to
expand their occupation.
In the African Horn, Angola welcomes the acceptance
by the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea of the
Framework Agreement prepared by the OAU with a view
to settling the dispute between the two countries. We wish
to call upon both countries to demonstrate flexibility in
order to ensure that a peace agreement, taking into account
the interests of their peoples, can be celebrated.
With respect to Somalia, we call upon the international
community to support the efforts of the OAU to reconcile
the political and military factions and to establish an elected
Government so that the country can resume its place in the
community of nations.
In Western Sahara, the fulfilment of the Ceasefire
Agreement enabled the further development of the joint
efforts of the United Nations and the OAU leading to the
holding of a referendum. Angola expects the process to
be transparent and fair and that both parties shall accept
the verdict of the Sahraoui people.
Concerning East Timor, whose people is connected
to Angola by a shared language and a historical past of
struggle against Portuguese colonization, we were
disturbed by the acts of violence that followed the
announcement of the results of the popular consultation.
The decision of East Timor’s people in favour of self-
determination and independence should be respected. It is
now the United Nations responsibility to prepare an
enabling environment. In this regard, we strongly support
the dispatch of a United Nations international peace force.
As to the Middle East, Angola welcomes the
celebration of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority that have enabled the
peace process to be relaunched. It is our view that the
new agreements conform to the aspirations of the
respective peoples to living in peace and security.
The Government of the Republic of Angola and its
people are concerned about the difficult political,
economic and social situation of the Cuban people, which
has worsened under the ongoing economic embargo
imposed on their country. We hope that the matter will be
resolved through a constructive bilateral dialogue.
The latest international developments and the
challenges of the next millennium require that the United
Nations and its main bodies, particularly those dealing
with peace and security, economic development and the
administration of international justice, be adjusted to the
new situation.
Reform and an increase in the membership of the
Security Council will be crucial to making the
decision-making process more transparent. In this respect,
it is essential that all the regions of the world be
represented equally. Angola reaffirms the position of the
non-aligned countries on the reform of the Security
Council, as well as the common African position adopted
by the OAU.
Despite the progress achieved in some economies
and the disappearance of the signs of a new world
depression, the international economic situation continues
to be characterized by serious imbalances. The root
35


causes of the difficult situation faced by some developing
countries include the unfair system governing international
economic, monetary and financial relations; the adoption of
protectionist measures; the unilateral nature of world trade;
and the worsening of the external debt, which has become
a heavy burden for the developing countries.
It is necessary to take concrete measures which may
lead to structural changes in international economic
relations and may contribute to the balance of the world
economy. To this end, there should be a serious and
transparent will in the North-South dialogue.



"
AGO,2011,"I would like 
to take this opportunity to congratulate the President of 
the General Assembly on his election to preside over 
the work of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and 
to assure him of Angola’s support and cooperation in 
ensuring success in the work of this session. I also 
want to express our gratitude to his predecessor, 
Mr. Joseph Deiss, for the competent and impartial 
manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the 
Assembly at its sixty-fifth session.  
 Allow me to also congratulate the Secretary-
General on his reappointment and to assure him of my 
Government’s support for the success of his very 
complex and demanding mission in the service of 
peace and cooperation among nations, a cornerstone of 
the mandate embodied in the Charter of the 
Organization. 
 We congratulate the Republic of South Sudan on 
its admission as a Member of the United Nations. We 
wish South Sudan a future of peace and prosperity and 
would like to say that the Government of Angola 
stands ready to cooperate with this new State’s efforts 
to consolidate its independence and its socio-economic 
development. 
 We also welcome the establishment of 
UN-Women. We are certain that it will give further 
impetus to the promotion and empowerment of women 
and the achievement of their legitimate rights. 
 This session of the General Assembly takes place 
at a particularly complex juncture in the international 
situation, which is characterized by so many crises that 
 
 
11 11-51398 
 
I believe it is not an exaggeration to say that they 
challenge the very foundations of our international 
Organization. If we were to list them, although not 
exhaustively, we could mention the current economic 
and financial crisis, which triggered the most serious 
social crisis witnessed to date by our generation; a 
dangerous environmental crisis of unpredictable 
consequences for the future of humankind, which will 
be irreversible unless the international community as a 
whole applies immediate and courageous measures; 
and a general escalation of violence and outbreak of 
conflict, which, combined with the environmental 
crisis, has caused the most serious humanitarian crisis 
that humankind has witnessed since the end of the 
Second World War. In brief, we are living in dangerous 
times, where a combination of factors is endangering 
stability, peace and security in the world. 
 The analysis of the current international situation 
made by the majority of the speakers who preceded 
me, and which we agree with, constitutes an appeal to 
our collective responsibility. 
 A particularly disturbing factor is the current 
economic and financial crisis, which has affected 
virtually every country in the world, in particular 
developing countries, with serious consequences for 
political stability and social cohesion. 
 It is therefore urgent that we find solutions to 
these problems. That will require strengthening 
international cooperation on the basis of greater justice 
and equality. Moreover, it is urgent that we take 
measures aimed at deepening economic reforms within 
States that promote economic growth and social 
development. 
 Angola is extensively affected by the 
international economic and financial crisis. We have 
therefore adopted a set of measures to mitigate its most 
adverse effects. Without prejudice to the maintenance 
of macroeconomic balance, we have focused 
considerable resources on social development and 
combating poverty. 
 The theme of this session of the General 
Assembly — “The role of mediation in the settlement 
of disputes through peaceful means” — reflects the 
deep concern of the international community with 
regard to the need for an integrated approach to 
resolving conflicts that affect it. That is what makes it 
necessary to implement mediation efforts after 
conflicts have started. Conflict prevention should be 
the key element in the management of any area of 
tension. 
 Respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, the 
rule of law and good governance are key elements in 
ensuring that any human society can live in peace and 
harmony. They are also the main guarantors of 
effective conflict prevention. 
 There are other elements I would like to mention 
that are also important causes of the spread of conflict. 
I am referring here to external interference, which, in 
gross violation of international law, frequently 
obstructs efforts at mediation and peaceful resolution 
and prevents the reaching of solutions to conflicts. 
 Angola has paid a very high price as a result of 
such interference, which for too long compounded a 
fratricidal conflict that Angolans were finally able to 
settle and wisely overcome with magnanimity, fairness 
and inclusion, thanks to the leadership of our President. 
The role of Angola and its contribution to internal and 
regional peace should be seen in the broader context of 
conflict resolution. In that regard, the implementation 
of the landmark Security Council resolution 435 (1978) 
led to the independence of Namibia and created the 
conditions for peaceful coexistence in a region that had 
endured extreme hostility and constituted a permanent 
threat to world peace. 
 Imbued with a spirit of fraternity, the 
Government of Angola has spared no effort in pursuing 
its policy of effective reconciliation, which has allowed 
the reconciliation of all its children who were 
previously involved in the conflict. There has been 
genuine investment in peace, which has been a decisive 
factor in the process of post-conflict reconstruction. 
Angola has served as a reference point for the 
resolution of several conflicts on the African continent. 
Moreover, we have spared no effort in sharing our 
experiences with other peoples and countries.  
 Also in the context of conflict resolution, it is 
important to strengthen the role of multilateralism 
while adhering to the principle of shared responsibility 
and shared benefits, recognizing the legitimate 
interests of all parties and engaging in consultations 
and dialogue in the search for workable solutions to 
international peace and security issues. 
 There is therefore a need to refer to the 
instruments of cooperation between the Security 
Council and the African Union, as well as to the role of 
  
 
11-51398 12 
 
the United Nations and regional institutions in 
preventing and resolving conflicts. It is of crucial 
importance to strengthen the action of regional 
organizations in the management of situations that may 
constitute threats to peace and security. In that 
connection, the Security Council has the primary role 
in preventing and resolving conflicts and in 
maintaining peace, in accordance with the powers 
conferred upon it by the Charter of the United Nations.  
 The central theme of our debate has drawn 
attention to the need for reform of the Security 
Council, including the imperative of achieving fair 
representation for all regions and increasing the 
number of permanent members, thereby adapting the 
Council to contemporary reality. 
 With regard to peaceful cooperation at the 
regional level, Angola is a member of the Southern 
African Development Community (SADC), the 
Economic Community of Central African States, the 
Gulf of Guinea Commission and the Community of 
Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), which, with 
several partners, has acted on the basis of preventive 
diplomacy in the search for peaceful solutions to the 
various crises that have arisen. 
 With regard to the constitutional crisis in 
Madagascar, SADC mediated the recent signing by all 
parties involved of the road map for the 
implementation of the reconciliation process, which is 
intended to lead to elections and the restoration of 
constitutional order. That was an important 
breakthrough in the process, which Angola welcomes. 
 Guinea-Bissau, our brotherly country and partner 
in the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, 
has been the subject of special attention by Angola. As 
part of the CPLP, Angola and other member States 
have striven to establish a strategic partnership with 
the Economic Community of West African States under 
the coordination of the United Nations, aiming to bring 
political stability to the country so that it can carry out 
major structural reforms, in particular the reform of the 
defence and security sectors. We welcome the positive 
developments that the country is now experiencing and 
we encourage the authorities of Guinea-Bissau to 
vigorously pursue the process of stabilization. 
 The drought in the Horn of Africa is a cause of 
deepest concern for my country and the entire 
international community. The consequences of drought 
in Somalia are felt even more profoundly due to the 
prevalence of armed conflict, which compounds the 
humanitarian crisis, shocks the world’s conscience and 
calls for a redoubled effort by the international 
community. Angola has joined the international 
humanitarian assistance efforts under way, as well as 
the search for political solutions to end the armed 
conflict and open new prospects for a better future for 
the Somali people. 
 With regard to the situation in Libya, the Angolan 
Government hopes that the Libyan people can find 
stability in the very near term. That can only be 
achieved through the free exercise of their democratic 
rights. In that regard, Angola urges the National 
Transitional Council to promote genuine national 
reconciliation and to form an inclusive Government, as 
those are prerequisites for ensuring that Libya can 
regain its rightful place in the African and international 
arenas. However, we must make use of lessons learned 
with a view to achieving more effective cooperation 
between external partners and the African Union in 
seeking joint solutions based on international law and 
mutual respect. 
 Angola remains concerned about the limited 
progress in addressing the problem of Western Sahara, 
which remains an important issue on the international 
agenda. We call on the warring parties to resume 
negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations 
and the African Union, so that the people of Western 
Sahara can exercise their right to self-determination. 
 The situation in the Middle East, particularly in 
the Palestinian territories, is one of the most serious 
problems facing the international community. Angola 
is witnessing with great concern the escalation of the 
conflict and the lack of progress towards a solution of 
the Palestinian question. In line with the general 
position of the international community regarding the 
conflict, my country advocates the establishment of an 
independent Palestinian State, living side by side with 
the State of Israel, in peace and security, within secure 
internationally recognized borders. 
 As in previous sessions, the sixty-sixth session of 
General Assembly will address the embargo imposed 
on Cuba, which violates the rules of international free 
trade. In spite of the timid steps taken towards 
normalizing the situation, Angola reiterates its position 
of principle by reaffirming the need to end the embargo 
against Cuba. 
 
 
13 11-51398 
 
 Angola has been making its contribution to 
finding solutions to the most pressing problems. Within 
the broader international community, we have sought 
to cooperate with all countries based on mutual respect 
and interests, upholding the highest ideals of peace and 
cooperation for development. We will continue on this 
path, firmly believing that the defence and promotion 
of these principles contribute to the development and 
advancement of all peoples."
AGO,2020,"His Excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations.
His Excellency Volkan Bozkir, President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly
Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government
Distinguished Delegates
Ladies and Gentlemen.
There is no memory since the Organization’s establishment of a situation in which the Heads of State and/or Government of the UN Member States, for reasons beyond their schedule, could not personally attend the General Assembly of the organization, which discusses the great topics about international relations and seeks to outline solutions aimed to resolve the main concerns of the mankind by ensuring peace, security and stability of our continent — our common home.
Today, despite the current circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposes on all of us restrictions in movements and all other procedures that are appropriate for this juncture, it has been possible to communicate amongst ourselves with a virtual feeling of being together thanks to the almost unlimited possibilities brought about by new technologies to the service of mankind.
Mr. Secretary General, please allow me to congratulate you on having taken the opportune decision to maintain the dynamics of the functioning of the United Nations with the technological resources at our disposal.
I also would like to highlight the exemplary manner how you have been tackling the problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, whose effects and consequences would have taken more dramatic proportions than those we are experiencing now, if the World Health Organization and other specialized agencies of the United Nations system did not act quickly and pass recommendations that have greatly helped control the spread of the disease.
Excellencies,
This pandemic has come to show at global level the weakness of our health structure in responding to a problem of so high magnitude and severity.
Despite this obvious evidence, through joint efforts, collaboration and cooperation amongst nations and exchanges among specialized scientific institutions we have managed to face the problem that was previously fully unknown, and that has obliged us to seek prompt response in order to alleviate the effects of the disease.
This global health problem has paralyzed all momentum that was built for the recovery of the world economy, which after the economic crisis that started in 2008, was already sending out encouraging signals for recovery and very specially in the developing countries, such as the case of Angola.
Our hopes of starting to yield positive results following our endeavour for domestic economy reform, conducted in a context where we had to apply harsh measures, with very tough impact on the lives of people, will not come true soon due to the current constraints that have disrupted the production chain, affecting the prices of the main export commodities, and paralysed services and other vital sectors of the economy, giving rise to very high unemployment rates and an alarming social situation.
One should single out that the resources we had for the financing of the productive sectors for its recovery had to be diverted, given the current context, to serve the needs of biosafety and other necessities of urgent epidemiological nature brought about by the pandemic.
In this regard, we were obliged to rapidly build throughout the national territory centres to host people under the situation of official quarantine, to equip the country’s hospitals with basic equipment for COVID-19-related medical emergencies and so on, to build hospital centres with capacity to treat possible outbreak of the pandemic and other related facilities.
I should acknowledge that apart from our own efforts, we have also benefited the solidarity of other countries, international organization, companies, and local and international nongovernment organizations as well as individual citizens who have helped mitigate somehow the pandemic impact in Angola, to whom we would like to thank.
Excellencies,
This human virtue that has always been useful at so critical moments such as the one that we are going through, helps immensely but it is not always enough to solve at grassroot the problems we are to face as a consequence of the very complex situations such as the one we are currently experiencing.
I therefore would like to express my appreciation for the G-20 initiative which has demonstrated the great sensitivity to the need for a collective action with a view relieving the debt of the developing countries as means to cushion the burden or liability that fall upon this group of countries.
We think that it is fundamental to view direct investment in the economies of developing countries as a great equation for their economic growth and development.
This goal may be achieved if developed countries mobilize themselves to establish funds for investments aid in Africa to be used by those investors interested in doing business in the African continent, where they may produce goods and services for local consumption and export.
Excellencies,
The COVID-19 pandemic has come to prove that when we act in coordination, responsibility is shared in a more efficient manner and thus more satisfactory results are achieved.
This vision supports the idea that multilateralism should always be present in any approach to be taken regarding the most pressing international issues facing the world.
For this reason, along its journey the United Nations has always advocated for multilateralism in resolving the intricate problems of Humanity.
Thus, we think within this spirit we should focus our endeavours in the search for fair and long lasting solutions to the problems of the Middle East, that have to do with Security Council pertinent resolutions on the matter, as well as those that are afflicting the African continent, where conflicts and instability still prevail, such as the case of Libya, the Sahel Region and others conflicts of minor scale in other regions of the continent.
It is worth to recognize that the nature of security problems in Africa, in many cases, is associated with the phenomenon of international terrorism, expansion of religious fundamentalism and post-election conflicts that require redoubled surveillance and attention by the United Nations, without forgetting the support to be rendered to those countries faced with these circumstances.
In light of the aforegoing, the United Nations should seek to interpret with impartiality the underlying factors of the domestic political tensions arising from election processes and assume a position that does not ignore the legitimately established Government, while strengthening their capacity to intervene in resolving the problems to ensure the normal functioning of institutions.
Excellencies,
The United Nations, within the current world context, which portrays a reality totally different from the one that was on the basis of its establishment, should seek to reflect within its internal structures the characteristics of the geopolitical reality of nowadays in order to render it into an organization that is able to safeguard the balance of global interests.
In this regard, we once more reiterate the urgent need for reform of the organization so as to achieve a UN Security Council that attends better to representation of the peoples, nations and continents.
Excellencies,
I thank you for your attention and wish that this 75th Session of the United Nations may attain its goals.
Thank you very much"
AGO,2016,"It is a great honour to speak on behalf of the President of the Republic of Angola, His Excellency José Eduardo dos Santos, in the General Assembly, which seeks to address and find solutions to the multidimensional challenges facing the world.
The General Assembly is indeed a privileged forum whose aim is to find solutions to the most pressing international problems, to preserve peace, to strengthen collective security and to help renounce the use of force in international relations, while respecting the sovereignty of States, the protection and promotion of human rights and the reaffirmation of the rule of law as fundamental principles of the international system.
During the seven decades of existence of the United Nations, there have been transformations in all aspects of life, such as a radical change in the nature of conflicts, international terrorism at unspeakable levels and unprecedented climate change. Those changes naturally require joint reflection on the role and future of the United Nations. We need an Organization capable of promoting international peace and security, acting quickly and effectively in conflict situations and addressing the most pressing challenges of our time. If for no other reason, these issues should provide an incentive to accelerate reforms aimed at revitalizing the United Nations system, in particular the Security Council.
In fact, reforming the Council is not merely optional but an imperative, and failure to carry it out could hinder the ability of the United Nations to act, thereby eroding its legitimacy and credibility.
The Republic of Angola is in favour of increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council in order to make it more representative and better equipped in its ability to respond to conflicts. For this reason, we reaffirm the right of the African continent to be represented among the permanent members of Security Council, as stated in the Ezulwini Consensus. We believe that the spirit of openness to dialogue, tolerance and common sense is key to solving the problems that currently plague humankind.
In this context, the Republic of Angola, which currently holds the presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, has been engaged, in both the United Nations Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council, in seeking bilateral and multilateral solutions to the problems affecting the region. In this regard, we reaffirm our determination to continue to support and promote dialogue, peace, security and stability in Central Africa and throughout the Great Lakes region of Africa.
We welcome the successful conclusion of the peace and electoral processes in the Central African Republic, which have enabled the country to start a new era. Their new era requires support from the international community in order to promote national reconstruction and consolidate the country’s institutions.
In South Sudan, the completion of the dialogue represents an important step towards the establishment of peace and the formation of a government of national unity to resolve the crisis in that country. The parties should be encouraged to honour their commitments, and the international community should maintain its support for the peace process.
With regard to Burundi, we call for the intensification of the dialogue for peace and urge respect for the legally established authority in order to overcome the impasse created by the post-electoral conflict. It is important to promote good neighbourliness and mutual security along the border separating Burundi from the adjacent countries.
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we encourage support for the electoral process in order to ensure peaceful and free elections, the preservation of peace and stability, the reconciliation process and the consolidation of democracy. In fact, peaceful elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are vital for peace, stability and development in the entire Great Lakes region of Africa. Both the United Nations and the African Union should devote special attention to the crises in Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Burundi.
We are facing a troubled international political environment that combines the escalation of conflicts — especially in the Middle East — with threats and constant episodes of violence that the international community has not been able to adequately address. Terrorism, a phenomenon that merits relentless combat, is the most extreme form of these threats. The world seems unprepared to deal with the ability of non-State groups and individuals eager to generate terror. The conflicts in Libya, Syria and Iraq in particular call for speedy resolution owing to their grave humanitarian repercussions.
The causes of those conflicts reside in the serious violations of the fundamental rights of the people involved and in foreign intervention, which has proved disastrous in its attempts to change the regime through the artificial imposition of supposed democracy, while the forced displacement of thousands of human beings that we see today constitutes a heartbreaking reality of human degradation and an offence against human dignity that demands an immediate and comprehensive response by the international community.
We recall that the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected by all Member States in all processes being implemented in the United Nations system. For this reason, it is worth highlighting that the process of détente between Cuba and the United States of America continues to need support from the international community. We welcome the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which we hope will translate to the lifting of the economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba.
I would like to state that the Republic of Angola is firmly committed to implementing the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by adopting appropriate measures at the national level, to be implemented over the next 15 years, for the benefit of our people and our planet and to promote prosperity, stability and peace. To this end, Angola considers it important for all Member States to take a holistic, integrated and comprehensive approach in all sectors and at all levels in order to maintain the universal and inclusive nature of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Climate change is one of the most complex and urgent issues of domestic and foreign policy that we face today because of its impact on migration, food security, natural resources, the spread of epidemics and even on social and economic instability. Thus the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change is a valuable, ambitious, balanced and fair tool for action whose entry into force will encourage collective efforts to control global warming.
The Republic of Angola emits only 0.17 per cent of all greenhouse gases. However, the effects of climate change are already being felt by us in many ways, such as the deterioration and shortening of cycles of drought and heavy rainfall, which pose a risk to agriculture and to economic and social infrastructures. Such effects also increase the incidence of various endemic diseases. It is therefore our intention to ratify the Paris Agreement as soon as possible as testimony to our unequivocal commitment and contribution to achieving its objectives. For similar reasons, we are motivated to participate in the third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, which will be held in Quito in October. The Conference represents an opportunity for us to adopt a new global urban agenda to promote strong links and synergies among urbanization, sustainable development and climate change.
The Republic of Angola is committed to three cross- cutting processes it considers of crucial importance: women and peace and security, peacekeeping operations and peacebuilding architecture. We recognize the vital role of women and the importance of their participation in all stages and levels of the peace process.
I would be remiss not to mention here that the Republic of Angola is a stable country from the perspectives of political and social conditions, and this has helped it to consolidate its unity, its national reconciliation process and its institutions. On the economic front, the challenges are greater today as a result of volatility in the prices of raw materials on the international market. But we continue to work to adjust our action plans, as well as to find pathways to economic growth and the improvement of the lives of our people.
I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at it seventy-first session and to assure him of Angola’s firm support during his tenure. I wish to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his excellent work during the seventieth session. Let me also express our deep appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for dedicating his talent and wisdom to the service of the United Nations for the past 10 years and making a tangible contribution to international peace and security and to a safer world for present and future generations.
"
AGO,1996,"﻿Allow me at the
outset to congratulate Mr. Ismail Razali on his election as
President of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session,
which is being held at a particularly difficult juncture. I am,
however, persuaded that his personal attributes as well as
his proven diplomatic experience will ensure the success
that is expected from this Assembly.
Allow me to express to His Excellency
Mr. Freitas do Amaral my congratulations on the
outstanding commitment he demonstrated during his term
in office. Our best wishes for the future go to him as he
resumes his work as an educator and conducts research for
peace and progress for all peoples.
Allow me also to express my warm appreciation to the
Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-
Ghali, for the dynamic and visionary manner in which he
conducted the business of our Organization during a time
of great change in the international arena. At this time the
United Nations is more and more frequently called upon to
rise to new challenges and is compelled to face tests that
are not always peaceful. For this difficult mission the
Republic of Angola will continue to render its modest
contribution for the successful accomplishment of his
mandate.
At the threshold of the new century of the third
millennium we are increasingly faced with new and
greater challenges, the solutions to which require joint and
concerted actions by all States, irrespective of their size,
economic potential or military might. In this context,
countries that have Portuguese as an official language —
Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Portugal and
Sao Tome and Principe — have recently decided to
establish a community of Portuguese-speaking countries
in order better to serve the interests of their peoples. We
would like to thank the Government and people of
Portugal for fostering a cordial climate for this
community of Portuguese-speaking countries.
It is essential, therefore, that a broad and in-depth
reform programme be adopted for multilateral institutions,
which would make a decisive contribution towards the
democratization of international relations on the basis of
the primacy of law, the safeguarding of the sovereign
equality of States and reciprocity in the comity of nations.
It is along these lines that we approach with all
seriousness the restructuring of the United Nations and its
system.
Our goal is to optimize the functioning of bodies
that coordinate the work of maintaining international
peace and security and fostering social and economic
development. Although innumerable international
conferences held by the United Nations in recent years
validate this concern, a great deal remains to be
accomplished. We must go from words of intention to
deeds.
In this context, we believe that the current session of
the General Assembly must approach with daring and
political resolve all current issues of common concern,
including those in the areas of international peacekeeping
and security and the healing of the economic and social
crisis that afflicts the developing world.
Last year our Organization celebrated its fiftieth
anniversary, and there was unanimous recognition by all
mankind of its role as the most important forum for
concerted action among nations. Although the
restructuring of the United Nations has always been an
19


issue of concern, it is now even more essential if we are to
rise to the challenges of the twenty-first century.
In this connection, I would like to avail myself of this
opportunity first of all to congratulate the Open-ended
High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the
United Nations System for the positive achievements we
have witnessed. Nevertheless, there is still a long road
ahead before we achieve our final objectives and make it
possible for our Organization to play its true role. As a
matter of fact, we are quite concerned by the current
financial crisis, which is affecting the proper operation of
our Organization and even threatening its very survival. In
this context, we support proposals that suggest practical
action for the correction of the financial situation, such as
the revision of the scale of assessments, the downsizing of
the Secretariat and some of its bodies, with a view towards
rendering them more efficient, less bureaucratic and less
burdensome.
By way of example, allow me to point out that several
developmental assistance projects or humanitarian aid
programmes are entrusted to foreign officials while they
could perfectly well be carried out by local officials with
similar qualifications, which could cut down the
implementation costs to less than one third. This is only
one example among the many we could cite that could go
far towards assisting with the financial healing of the
Organization.
The measures we have alluded to are feasible and
could bring about greater benefits and substantially improve
the functioning of the Organization and its specialized
agencies.
As regards the Security Council, my Government has
always supported its restructuring in order to strengthen its
role and effectiveness and ensure greater transparency in
the decision-making process and in the implementation of
its resolutions. Our position therefore is identical to the one
adopted by the Organization of African Unity. It would
expand the Security Council and provide for fair and equal
representation by permanent and non-permanent members,
with equal rights and duties. Africa’s claim to at least two
permanent seats on the Security Council is nothing but its
proper and due right. We likewise support the right of other
regions to representation on the Council, with the status of
permanent members.
Regarding the modes of operation of the Security
Council, we believe that the areas concerned will find their
appropriate modus operandi.
In several regions of our planet, there are still
decades-old conflicts, and new sources of tension are
breaking out in areas that previously enjoyed a certain
peace and stability. This offsets the most optimistic
expectations of our peoples, who had hoped that the
world would be on the threshold of a new era of peace in
this post-cold-war period, paving the way for cooperation
and development.
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note
a proliferation of regional conflicts, social and economic
collapse in some of our countries, environmental decay,
and the coming of new scourges such as transnational
crime, drug trafficking, a rising wave of criminality, racial
disturbances, xenophobia, and religious and cultural
intolerance.
It is in the face of this bleak picture that we come
together for the fifty-first session of the General
Assembly, compelling us to pause in deep introspection
and firm resolve to handle this time bomb. In this context,
the Republic of Angola urges all Member States to do
their very best in the search for ways and means to
achieve this. One of the main tools available to us is
preventive diplomacy and the political resolve of all those
who are in a position to make a decisive contribution to
international peace and security.
In the Middle East, recent events are showing
dangerous trends, jeopardizing the Washington agreement
on the autonomy of the Palestinian people and the first
steps towards the joint peaceful settlement of peace issues
in that region, all of which are matters of the greatest
concern to the Republic of Angola.
The Republic of Angola reiterates the stand adopted
on the Middle East by African Heads of State or
Government at the thirty-second summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity, in Yaoundé, and appeals
to the parties for strict compliance with their
commitments, because nothing can resist the resolve of a
people to be free. As stated by a great leader of our
century, Ho Chi Minh, “Nothing is more precious than
freedom and independence”.
We are likewise concerned at the grievous situation
in East Timor, a non-autonomous territory illegally
occupied by Indonesia, in violation of the principles
established in the United Nations Charter and applicable
resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security
Council.
20


My Government reaffirms that the United Nations has
a great responsibility vis-à-vis the people of East Timor and
should not fail in it. In this context, the Republic of Angola
supports and encourages dialogue between Portugal, the
administering Power, and Indonesia in search of a
settlement that will bring self-determination and
independence to the people of Timor.
We are, likewise, profoundly concerned by the
difficult social and economic situation in the Republic of
Cuba resulting from the financial and economic blockade
imposed on that member State of the General Assembly.
The Government of Angola supports the General
Assembly resolutions appealing for the lifting of the
economic blockade in favour of the Cuban people, which
is suffering under the negative effects of that measure. We
therefore encourage a dialogue with a view to normalizing
relations between those two sovereign Member States of the
Organization, which we call the United Nations, not the
divided nations.
In the course of the next century, one of the greatest
challenges to the United Nations will be the protection and
promotion of human rights. The Government of Angola has
always recognized the indivisible and universal character of
the fundamental rights of every human being and the
intrinsic correlation between human rights, democracy and
development. Thus, at the Commission on Human Rights
and other forums, Angola has always categorically
condemned selectivity and its politicization.
We condemn human rights violations, wherever they
may occur. This attitude, however, should not serve as a
pretext for sectarianism, exerting pressures designed to
create political instability in sovereign States, or the
implementation of hidden agendas. This practice harms
rather than fosters the promotion and protection of human
rights.
Allow me to take this opportunity to inform the
Assembly that, at the proposal of President José Eduardo
dos Santos, and in coordination with the United Nations
Centre for Human Rights, the 32nd summit meeting of the
Heads of State and Government of the Organization of
African Unity decided to hold this year a ministerial-level
meeting devoted exclusively to in-depth consideration of the
issue of human rights in Africa. The Republic of Angola
will have the privilege of hosting this conference, which we
believe is of tremendous relevance in the lengthy and
difficult process of democratization in our continent.
The crisis that is currently affecting the global
economy is mostly structural in nature and results from
inconsistency, lack of coordination, and the adoption of
macroeconomic policies incompatible with the growth
needs of the developing world. Of great concern is the
realization that the current growth rate of some of our
countries is often negative. This compels whole
populations to lead lives of starvation and extreme
poverty. It is indeed unfair that, at the threshold of the
third millennium, there are still some 800 million
malnourished people across the world.
Africa is the continent most lacking in capital and
technology and, as a result, its population growth rate far
exceeds its food-production capacity. In turn, this
increases poverty and starvation and can lead to serious
social unrest. These consequences can be avoided if we
are able to rely on the understanding and goodwill of our
creditors and major international financial institutions,
which impose economic management prescriptions
without regard for each nation’s realities.
In our view, one of the basic keys to the economic
and social development of our countries lies in the
expansion and reorientation of economic cooperation for
development. We must map out as soon as possible a
global developmental strategy that will contribute to the
solution of the problems now affecting the survival of our
economies.
Today, our world has reached such a level of
interdependence that new levels of interaction among our
economies are required if we are to survive, enjoy
stability and avoid the threat of the imminent breakdown
suffered by the weaker nations. My Government reaffirms
its support for the United Nations special initiative on
Africa and, at the same time, underscores the need for
greater assurances of success, in view of our experience
with similar programmes in the past. Once again, a word
of praise is due to the Secretary-General for this initiative,
which again demonstrates that the world, and the United
Nations in particular, has not turned its back on Africa.
If the African continent is to overcome its social and
economic crisis, a broad marshalling of financial and
other resources will be necessary before the end of this
century in order to meet the social and economic
development needs of the continent. Likewise, we are
deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of
Africa and other developing countries, as well as by the
heavy burden involved in debt servicing, which is one of
21


the causes of the continuous economic and social
deterioration of our standard of living.
We believe that a fair and lasting solution can be
found for the African foreign-debt crisis, as long as there is
understanding and a strong political resolve on the part of
creditors. For certain developing nations, the negotiation of
a debt roll-over is a feasible solution. For the less-
developed nations, however, the sole viable solution is total
forgiveness of the debt and a massive effort in the area of
international cooperation for development through
partnerships. The strengthening of South-South cooperation
and regional economic integration are processes that pave
the way for the establishment of a more equitable, new
international economic order, free from measures of
protectionism that hinder international trade and give rise to
discrimination against our nations.
Of equal concern is the deteriorating food situation in
Africa due to drought and other natural disasters. This can
be addressed only through special assistance from the
international community for the development of the food
and agricultural sectors and of food self-sufficiency in
African countries. We extend our best wishes for success to
the World Food Summit scheduled to take place in
November in Rome, of which His Excellency Mr. José
Eduardo dos Santos will be a sponsor.
My Government has focused special attention on
issues of environment and human settlements and we take
this opportunity to underscore the positive impact in Angola
of the programmes and related activities in our continent
sponsored by the United Nations Environmental Programme
and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements. In
spite of all the difficulties it faces, Angola has spared no
effort in combating desertification and drought in Africa.
We congratulate those countries that volunteered to host the
Convention to Combat Desertification and urge all countries
to ratify it, thus enabling it to enter into force as soon as
possible.
Illegal drug trafficking and the chemical-precursors
trade, together with money laundering, represent another
scourge that is destabilizing our nations. Drug trafficking
for us, therefore, is an international problem requiring
cooperation among all countries worldwide. With the
support of the United Nations International Drug Control
Programme and the assistance of other United Nations
specialized agencies, my Government has drafted and
submitted to our Parliament updated legislation relating to
our struggle against the traffics in illegal drugs,
psychotropic substances and chemical precursors. This law
was enacted recently, but we still lack the technical and
expert resources to ensure the success of that campaign.
In southern Africa, we have coordinated our policies
in this area so as to score significant successes, both
nationally and regionally. The results are satisfactory and
encouraging.
Today, just as it was 51 years ago , the struggle for
peace continues to be one of the fundamental goals of our
Organization. We must therefore devote all our efforts
and energy to the creation of a better world instead of
preparing for new wars of self-destruction.
My Government has signed, and the Angolan
Parliament has just ratified, the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We support the efforts
to ban new nuclear tests. We also reiterate our appeal for
respect for and preservation of the African continent and
its contiguous areas as a nuclear-free zone, in accordance
with the Pelindaba Treaty.
The Republic of Angola is today one of the
countries in which the largest number of anti-personnel
land-mines can be found. There are over 10 million mines
laid in Angolan territory. These mines have inflicted
innumerable casualties, and over 100,000 people have
been mutilated in my country. My Government supports
all efforts towards a total ban on the production and
export of anti-personnel land-mines and their use in
domestic or international conflicts.
With the Assembly’s permission, I would like to
address the situation in Africa, which today seems like a
corpse on which vultures come to feed.
Some countries of our continent still face serious
obstacles due to negative interference in the peace process
and in their efforts to promote economic development, the
well-being of African peoples and the establishment of
peace, security and political stability.
The problem of conflicts in Africa is undoubtedly
one of the crucial issues affecting the development and
stability of our continent. The Government of Angola
would like to praise the efforts of the Central Organ of
the Organization of African Unity’s Mechanism for
Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution in
various African regions and countries, such as Burundi,
Liberia and Somalia.

In this connection, we support the efforts of the
neighbouring countries and others that advocate a
negotiated political settlement for the crisis in Burundi on
the basis of the country’s constitutional legal order and in
consonance with the legitimate interests of the parties. We
believe that if this objective is to be achieved, there must
be a global dialogue among the parties concerned.
We would like to pay tribute to the former President
of Tanzania, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, for his efforts to
reunite our Burundian brothers who have fallen into enmity
around the negotiating table. We are convinced that good
will on the part of the politicians will help our sister nation
of Burundi overcome its critical difficulties.
Concerning Liberia, we would like to congratulate the
member countries of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) for the significant progress
made so far, culminating in the swearing in of
Ms. Ruth Perry as Chairperson of the Liberian Council of
State and the beginning of the belligerent parties’ process
of disarmament.
Unfortunately, we are still concerned over the situation
of Somalia. We feel that in Somalia, as in the case of other
conflicts, there is no other way to find peace than through
dialogue between the parties concerned.
We would like to reaffirm our support for the
countries in that region, and particularly for the Prime
Minister of Ethiopia in his efforts to bring the Somali
factions together around a negotiating table. We also feel
that the United Nations should not and cannot renounce its
duty and abandon that country to its fate.
Finally, we cannot fail to restate our position of
principle regarding the issue of Western Sahara — namely,
our support for the United Nations and Organization of
African Unity resolutions in that regard. We are convinced
that the problem can be resolved only through a referendum
on the self-determination of that territory.
We support a peaceful solution to the conflict, taking
into account the interests of the parties, particularly that of
the Saharan people, and we offer congratulations on the
resumption of direct talks between the Kingdom of
Morocco and POLISARIO.
I would not wish to conclude my statement without
apprising the Assembly in general terms of the situation
prevailing in my country during the implementation of the
Lusaka Protocol, aimed at restoring lasting peace and
reconciliation for all Angolans.
Prior to doing so, however, I would like to express
the sincere appreciation of the Government of Angola to
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Angola, Maître Alioune Blondin Beye, as well as to the
representatives of the troika of observer nations —
Portugal, the Russian Federation and the United States of
America — for the unswerving efforts they have made,
individually and jointly, for peace and national
reconciliation in Angola.
Although the peace process has evinced a certain
dynamism since the Franceville and Libreville meetings
between the President of the Republic,
His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos, and the
leader of UNITA, Mr Jonas Savimbi, we have been
confronted with certain situations that are rather
unfavourable for its normal and desirable development.
As the Assembly knows, the implementation of the
Lusaka Protocol included a calendar of specific tasks for
the Government and for UNITA.
The position adopted by the UNITA leadership
concerning the honouring of its commitments has,
unfortunately, given rise to deplorable situations in the
course of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, in
spite of the fact that the Government has gone beyond
meeting its commitments under the calendar.
As a matter of fact, not only did UNITA fail to
honour its commitments and fail to comply with the
pertinent Security Council resolutions, but it failed to
carry out fundamental commitments in the peace process:
it failed to confine all its true military forces to quarters;
it did not surrender its light and heavy matériel; it did not
bring about the induction of all its general officers into
the regular armed forces of Angola, in accordance with
the agreement; it continued to create impediments and
difficulties in the selection and induction of 26,300 troops
into the national army of Angola; and, finally, it
prevented the free circulation of people and goods, thus
delaying the extension of the State administration over the
entire national territory.
As members know too, at its Congress, held from 20
to 28 August this year, UNITA rejected the offer made to
its leader by the Government of the position of Vice-
President of the Republic. By so acting, UNITA created
an additional difficulty for the formation of the
23


Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. That
attitude on the part of the leader of UNITA did not come
as a surprise to many observers of the Angolan peace
process because it is in keeping with Mr. Savimbi’s
habitual lack of coherence. He has always placed his self-
interest far ahead of the interests of the Angolan nation.
Consequently, it is more than evident that UNITA is trying
to impose strategic delays on the peace process and the
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, to aggravate the
social and economic crisis and to distort the Protocol and
other commitments assumed.
However, despite the difficulties encountered in the
process, the Angolan Government is resolute in its intent to
spare no effort to resolve all the country’s problems
through dialogue and collective commitment. Our
Government, working hand in hand with the democratic
forces interested in peace and national reconciliation in
Angola, has decided that, regardless of circumstances, we
will put an end to the cycle of strife that is disrupting the
country. We will launch a new era of peace and political
tolerance, strengthen democratic institutions and save the
Angolan nation from the economic and social chaos into
which it has been plunged by the stubborn attitude of those
who try to block the wind with their bare hands.
In this connection, I should like to thank the
international community for its efforts and understanding in
the search for peace in Angola. We are aware of the
tremendous costs involved in the operation of United
Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), but
this is a very sensitive juncture and the perseverance of the
international community is of the essence, for victory is
certain. Only with the victory of peace and democracy in
Angola can we say that the sacrifice of the international
community has been worthwhile.
In the achievement of those objectives the participation
of UNITA is essential. We therefore urge the international
community to continue to exert pressure to compel the
leader of UNITA to follow a reasonable course, renouncing
war once and for all, and to persuade him to occupy his
position in Angolan society.
For more than 30 years the Angolan people have been
subjected to successive wars that have caused and still
cause indescribable suffering. After the election in
September 1992, Angola was once again plunged into a war
that forced all Government activities to be directed at an
emergency social policy, the sole objective of which was to
mitigate the nefarious consequences that afflicted the lives
and dashed the hopes of Angolans.
That conflict created over 2 million displaced
persons directly affected by the conflict; it drove over half
a million refugees into neighbouring countries and
maimed more than 100,000 people. In the economic
sphere, it destroyed over 70 per cent of the social and
economic infrastructure and the agro-industrial base.
Those are only a few of the many indicators that
reveal the true dimensions of the catastrophe that has
befallen Angolans and that has led to a serious
deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the country.
Given the tragic situation we described earlier, my
Government is no longer in a position to face this
challenge on its own. What is at stake is the survival of
millions of human beings.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity
sincerely to thank the international community and
Governments, as well as governmental and non-
governmental organizations, for the assistance they have
extended to the Angolan people. I would implore them to
continue to assist the needy population without losing
sight of assistance for development and self-sufficiency.
We peaceful Angolans and our Government will not
abdicate our responsibilities.
Once again, I extend our best wishes to the President
for success as he presides over the General Assembly at
this session and pledge to him my delegation’s full and
sincere cooperation.





"
AGO,1991,"﻿Allow me first to congratulate Mr. Shihabi on his election to the presidency of this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly and to join preceding speakers, to wish him every success in conducting this session of the United Nations General Assembly. We realise how difficult a task it is but we have confidence in his experience and diplomatic skills and his personal commitment and wise judgement will certainly help him lead this session successfully. I would like to extend my congratulations also to those others who were elected at this Assembly. We are certain that their valuable support will ensure success in the work that we are going to be doing here. Allow mew, therefore, to convey to Mr. 8hihabi, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and on my own behalf, the total confidence we have in his presidency and to pledge the total support and cooperation of our delegation.
It is also a great honour for me to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his enlightened leadership of this Organisation in the course of his two terms of office. In fact, it is with a sense of pride and achievement that we have witnessed during this time the settlement of some of the most serious conflicts that seemed to be going to last indefinitely. I am referring specifically to the colonial situation that prevailed in Zimbabwe and in Namibia until recently, to the Iran-Iraq conflict and to the efforts undertaken to solve the Sahraoni question, among others. In fact, the Secretary-General's determination and personal commitment contributed a great deal to their settlement, thus allowing for the restoration of justice, peace and security to those territories
May I also extend my warmest congratulations to the newest Members of the Organisation, the Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Micronesia and the two brotherly countries of North Korea and South Korea.
The forty-sixth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of extreme importance for the history of mankind, as the world situation is evolving towards detente in international relations - this is in spite of the considerable difficulties that remain to be overcome, most of which arise from the obstinate attitude of certain segments of society who are reluctant to accept the positive steps that have been made in order to establish a sound climate of  understanding among people on this planet, conducive to the kind of relations that reflect the lofty aspirations of peace, freedom, justice and social welfare.
We believe, however, that common sense will motivate people to re-examine their obsolete positions, if they find themselves unable to adjust to the relentless and irreversible progress made in contemporary history.
As a matter of fact, the detente that characterises international relations today was an important factor in the major steps made towards the settlement of the main problems afflicting the world community, thanks to the efforts undertaken in recent years that allowed the cold war to give way to dialogue and the use of force to be replaced by the peaceful settlement of conflicts.
The recent signing of the START Treaty between he United States of America and the Soviet Union after talks lasting for nine years is clear evidence that through negotiation people can in fact arrive at an understanding, remove obstacles and eliminate impending threats that may be catastrophic to the future of humankind - all without resorting to force.
However, in order to reach such an understanding it is imperative that foreign interests do not prevail over the interests of a nation and its people. He firmly believe that strict compliance with this principle would enable the warring parties to reflect on their differences and to arrive at a settlement, thus avoiding military confrontation and the inevitable catastrophic consequences, as was the case in the recent Persian Gulf war where thousands of innocent civilians fell victim to massacre.
For that reason my Government heartily applauds this gesture of mutual understanding and trust by the two super-Powers, a significant step toward on the road before us, which is still a long one, and urges both of them, as well as all the armament-producing countries, to continue to implement the necessary measures so that in the near future we can arrive at general and complete disarmament on the planet. This is the ultimate aspiration of the whole of mankind, which yearns for unrestricted freedom, peace and tranquillity.
The Angolan Government attaches great importance to the positive political developments in southern Africa. In Angola, with the signing of the peace agreements between the Government and UMITA, on 31 May 1991, in Bicesse, Portugal, the peace process in the sub-Saharan region of Africa continued its course.
For the Angolan people the coming of peace as a result of the above-mentioned agreement constitutes undoubtedly one of the most remarkable events in contemporary history since 1961 and the beginning of the struggle for national liberation against colonialism followed by our country's accession to independence in 1975 and the ensuing foreign aggression and internal conflict it endured.
The revision of our constitutional law, affected even before the signing of the peace agreements, as well as the adoption of new legislation consistent with the revised Constitution, created conditions conducive to the setting up of mechanisms that will facilitate the scheduled multi-party elections and the establishment of the rule of law in Angola. This will open the doors to broader prospects for the full exercise of democracy in the new society to whose creation all national forces, political and other, will contribute.
This achievement of the Angolan people will inevitably have a positive impact on the entire subregion, as it will give a new dynamic dimension to the economic activities of all the members of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference. We believe that this success will create an environment of greater openness and trust in our relations with other countries and entities that want to do business with us.
The Angolan people and Government are open to all initiatives that might contribute further to what has already been achieved in our country and promote greater development. It is essential, however, that this optimistic and irreversible journey that the Angolan people are ready to undertake, voluntarily and on their own initiative, not be thwarted or disrupted in any way by alien forces, either inside or outside the country.
I should like to take this opportunity to express once again the appreciation and gratitude of the Angolan people and the Angolan Government to the Portuguese Government for its dedicated commitment and for its mediation efforts to find a solution to the Angolan conflict. These culminated in the signing of the agreement that restored tranquillity to my country.
I extend my acknowledgments to the Governments of the United States of America and of the Soviet Union, as well as to the United Nations Secretary-General, whose representatives played an invaluable role as observers at the talks.
Finally, the Angolan and Cuban Governments should be given credit for the major role they played in the peace process. Angola and Cuba adhered strictly to their commitment to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angolan territory. This process was completed by 15 July 1991 - ahead of the schedule that had been agreed upon - as a gesture of good will on the part of the two Governments.
In addition to the peace process in Angola, which I have just described as a very important historical event, another event constituted a landmark for the southern region of Africa. I refer to the abolition by the South African Government of the last set of laws that upheld and sustained the apartheid system. However, the acts of violence that constantly occur in South African townships create a climate of instability that is an aberrant contradiction of the climate of hope created with the abolition of the apartheid laws. It is therefore crucial that the South African Government adopt the appropriate measures to put an end to this situation.
In spite of the repeal of the apartheid laws, not all questions related to the continued existence of this political regime have been resolved. For example, there is the question of the release of all political prisoners, and the established authorities continue to make mass, arbitrary arrests. This situation is in every way similar to that prevailing under the old regime. It is imperative that there should be created a constituent assembly including all patriotic representative groups in South Africa. This assembly would draft the new constitution. An interim government must be formed to administer the country during the transition period, until free and fair elections are held on a basis of one man, one vote.
For all those reasons, my Government considers as premature the total lifting of sanctions against South Africa favoured by some Governments.
I should like to comment now on the situation in Mozambique. The efforts made by the Government of that country to achieve peace have been constantly frustrated by foreign interference, which hurts the legitimate interests of the Mozambican people. The Angolan people pledge solidarity with the brotherly people of Mozambique, and my Government encourages the Mozambican Government to persevere in its peace efforts by holding direct negotiations with RENAMO, and urges the international community to refrain from any action that might slow down the negotiations or misrepresent their results.
On the other hand, one sovereignty issue in southern Africa remains to be resolved. I refer to the Walvis Bay Port Territory, which has been recognised in various General Assembly and Security Council resolutions as an integral part of Namibia.
The People's Republic of Angola has been following closely the political developments in different parts of the globe.
Indonesia's illegal occupation of the Territory of East Timor persists, in violation of internationally accepted rules and principles of international law, and in disregard of the rights and legitimate interests of the Timorese people. The Angolan people and Government pledge their solidarity with the people of East Timor in their just struggle for national independence. We are in favour of talks between Portugal, as the administrating Power overseeing the Territory, and Indonesia, without excluding the physical presence of representatives of East Timor as a direct and concerned party, so that a fair and comprehensive solution may be found - a solution that takes into account, above all, the legitimate interests and rights of the Maubere people.
In the Middle East, the prospects for a speedy solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict are discouraging. In our view, the Jewish settlements in occupied Arab territories tend to worsen the conflict rather than contributing in any way to its solution.
In the Angolan Government's view, it is crucial that an International conference on the Middle East be urgently convened to bring together all parties involved, including the Palestine Liberation Organisation - an honourable representative of the Palestinian people, which has been fighting for decades for the right to self-determination.
We cannot fail to refer, however briefly, to the more effervescent political situations in other regions today.
As regards Africa, we reaffirm the right of the peoples in this region to decide their future freely, without foreign interference in the shape of the formation of, or support for, insurgent armed groups, through direct military intervention, or by any other means.
In Latin America, interventionist policies, aggression, economic embargoes and interference in the internal affairs and against the interests of another State continue to be a strong threat to the sovereignty of nations in the region, as well as to peace and international security. Such conduct is increasingly in sharp contrast to the growing tendency to seek peaceful solutions to conflicts. 
The People's Republic of Angola welcomes all initiatives towards the reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Korean peninsula. Proposals for the reunification of Korea must be considered positively, as they can be of great significance for the Korean people and for the peninsula as a whole.
The Angolan Government cannot remain indifferent to world economic problems. This is especially so in view of Angola's position in Africa, which is one of the most impoverished regions of the world. In the early 1980s Angola joined other nations in their firm commitment to improve the world economic environment, and, together, help to overcome hunger, poverty, malnutrition and disease epidemics and eliminate illiteracy, and to solve problems inherent in underdevelopment, in order that people might be offered a more dignified life.
But as we look at the world economic situation today we realise that, in spite of the efforts undertaken by the international community, it has not been possible so far to solve the problems that affect mainly the developing countries. This was the conclusion drawn at the eighth special session of the General Assembly, held last year, which was devoted to international economic cooperation, and particularly to the re-examination of economic growth and development. 
In fact, instead of batter balance between the development of the richer countries and that of poorer countries, we are seeing a growing tendency towards polarisation. One example would be that in International trade relations protectionist policies are still being used by the developed countries. The price of raw material exports is constantly declining, and trade conditions continue to deteriorate, undermining efforts by the developing countries to restructure their economies.
Another factor that constitutes a major obstacle to the economic and social development of developing countries is their foreign debt. We believe that developing countries, which are the debtors, and the developed countries, which are the creditors, should make use of the available mechanisms and take measures to put an end to the wasting of resources that we see in the developing countries. This point was recently acknowledged at a ministerial-level meeting of non-aligned countries in Accra.
Me are, nevertheless, convinced that, if the strategy for international development for the Fourth United Nations Decade for Development, adopted at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, is implemented, many problems will be more easily solved.
As we have already mentioned, Africa is the most impoverished continent on cur planet, in spite of the vast natural resources with which it is endowed. In fact the constant deterioration of the economic situation in most African countries, caused by losses in export revenues, either because of the staggering costs of imports or because of their serious foreign debt, which has reached more than $270 billion, is a reason for our Governments to feel concerned, because it constitutes a new factor conducive to political and social instability.
A few days ago the United Nations evaluated its Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, which was adopted approximately five years ago. As we can see, the results are not very encouraging. The international community should give more support towards the effective implementation of this Programme, because otherwise the African countries will not be able to deal with the crisis that is eroding the continent. The situation is further worsened by the significant changes that have taken place in political and economic relations, with particular relevance to the developments in Eastern Europe.
As regards the economic situation in southern Africa, we are hopeful that the ending of the war in Angola and Mozambique and the complete abolition of apartheid in South Africa will open new and broad prospects for economic development for the benefit of countries in the subregion, through the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC). Taking this objective into account, its member countries are relying increasingly on the support of the international community; this support can be an invaluable contribution to the solution of social problems afflicting the people in the subregion.
In December 1989 the United Nations adopted resolution 44/168, on international assistance for the economic recovery of Angola. For the reasons stated at the time, it has not yet been possible to implement it effectively. We believe, however, that, given the present conditions in our country, it is now possible to implement it more expeditiously. We believe that the donor countries, which have been somewhat apprehensive in the past, can now be reassured. 

We should like once again to thank the Member States that in one way or another have helped us, and we appeal to them to maintain a firm commitment to the continuance o£ assistance to the People's Republic of Angola.
"
AGO,2019,"I would like to salute all present from this important rostrum. I hope that this session will represent a further decisive step in the search for peace and international security and towards a fairer and more balanced relationship among all nations.
Ongoing political and military conflicts, including pervasive economic inequalities, pose a permanent threat to all humankind — a fact that compels us to unite in a common effort to solve the real problems that constitute our priorities, such as by protecting the environment and definitively eradicating hunger and
poverty, endemic diseases, human trafficking, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, terrorism and other threats against peace, in order to create an environment conducive to social progress and development. In order to meet those noble goals, it is imperative that we focus all our efforts on the peaceful resolution of conflicts that have created a permanent climate of tension and imminent war in some countries.
We stand for multilateralism in international relations, as it alone contributes effectively to the world’s peace and security. For that reason, it is never too much to insist on the need for a deep reform of the United Nations, so that the Organization can better fulfil its great responsibility for conflict management and resolution and the prevention of war. We reiterate the need to increase the number of permanent members of the Security Council, in particular to include members from Africa and South America, as the current composition, which at the time of the Council’s formation mainly comprised the winning Powers of the Second World War, no longer reflects the need for a fairer global geostrategic balance.
The prevailing tension on the Korean peninsula, which constitutes a danger to world peace, should remain one of the major concerns of the international community. We therefore encourage and commend the diplomatic efforts being made by the major world Powers — the United States of America, Russia and China — to make that part of our planet a zone of peace and security.
We are also concerned about the perpetual Middle East conflict. It is crucial that the many relevant Security Council resolutions be upheld, in particular those calling for the establishment of an independent Palestinian State that can live in peace with the State of Israel and for those two countries to develop normal neighbourly relations and economic cooperation.
With regard to the growing tension in the Persian Gulf, where extensive reserves of crude oil are threatened by latent conflict that imminently endangers global energy security, we call on all parties to exercise moderation. The best solutions are found at the negotiating table.
Africa, our continent, has been ravaged by terrorism, especially that of a religious fundamentalist nature, which affects countries such as Mali, the Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Central African Republic and Somalia, to name just a few. The international community — and the African Union in particular — should pay special attention to the need to normalize the political situation in Libya, as its territories, which are controlled by different militias, constitute the logistical source of the arms and ammunition of the fundamentalist groups operating in Africa.
Angola has made a modest contribution to conflict prevention and resolution as often as it can, in particular in the Southern African Development Community and the Great Lakes and Central African regions, the most recent case being the Rwanda-Uganda memorandum of understanding signed in Luanda, which seems to represent an important step towards preventing a simmering conflict that was about to break out.
I would like to take this opportunity to call from this rostrum for an end to the decades-old economic embargo imposed on Cuba, especially given the recent window of opportunity for rapprochement and normalcy of relations. Allow me to also call for an end to the current trade war between two economic Powers, the United States and China, considering the negative consequences that are already being felt in the global economy.
The world is helplessly witnessing the effects of climate change and global warming, which have been worsening as confirmed by the latest scientific studies, as well as the rapid rise of natural hazards and their devastating consequences, such as the typhoons, cyclones, tsunamis, floods and even severe droughts that are proliferating around the world.
Stark examples of such hazards are multiplying all over the world, which leads us to associate ourselves with those who point out the responsibility of those who persist in ignoring those signs and feel entitled to continue supporting polluting industries. We welcome the initiative taken by the recent protests in many countries around the world, which have become a true symbol of advocacy to preserve the environment and defend our planet — our common home.
Let us work together to preserve the remaining rainforests in South America, Africa and Asia, such as the forests of the Amazon and Congo river basins, which have not yet been completely devastated by humankind. Those are the planet’s last reserves for oxygen renewal and also absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants that deplete the ozone layer.
Although noble and fair, the Sustainable Development Goals, which were intended to give continuity to the Millennium Development Goals, are not themselves a guarantee of better results in the future. In order for us to achieve the desired levels of sustainable development, it is important to make the expected outcomes of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the object of positive brainstorming on alternative projects that are appropriate to the political situations and concrete realities of the countries most affected.
Conflict, hunger, misery and disease cannot be eliminated by political and bureaucratic solutions alone, but also — and more importantly — by good governance, combating corruption and other social evils, protecting the environment and strengthening values such as human dignity, responsible and inclusive citizenship, social justice and equal opportunities.
It is important in that context to highlight the role of young people, the only force capable of overcoming all those challenges. It is imperative to enhance the quality of their education, both technically and culturally, so that their specific training takes into account the contribution of the different cultures and civilizations which, for centuries, have helped us to better understand and love the world of our fellow human beings. It is with firm hope in the commitment of young people that I remain optimistic and continue to believe that we can bequeath a better world to our descendants.
Speaking of Angola in particular, I would like to highlight the major ongoing reforms that aim to build a truly democratic State that respects the rule of law, fights corruption and impunity, and promotes a culture of accountability among civil servants. Such reforms will create a business environment that is more attractive to domestic and foreign private investment, thereby increasing the domestic production of goods and services, reducing the import of foreign goods and increasing the range and quantity of exportable domestic goods as well as the supply of jobs.
The Government is addressing all those challenges very seriously and transparently. Among other measures, approximately 150 State-owned companies and assets from different sectors of the economy, including the oil and gas sector, are being privatized. We have also launched an ambitious plan for the construction and rehabilitation of water and energy production and distribution infrastructures, as well as the construction of hospitals, educational establishments and secondary and tertiary roads and other repairs across the country’s 164 municipalities, the budget for which has already been secured.
Finally, I take this opportunity to declare that Angola is now open to the world and to foreign investment in all areas of its economy.
"
AGO,1995,"Permit me at
the outset, Sir, on behalf of the Government of the
Republic of Angola and of my entire delegation that is
accompanying me, to express my satisfaction at your
election to the presidency of this session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations. We are convinced that
your excellent personal qualities and the diplomatic skill
you have accumulated will guarantee the success of the
conduct of the work of this significant session. Your
election is also well-deserved recognition of the important
contribution which your country has made to the
promotion of peace and international security. I assure
you, at this stage, of the cooperation of my delegation.
We commit ourselves to doing everything to support this
arduous but honourable task with humility and a sense of
responsibility.
I cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing
my appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Amara
Essy, for the dedication and interest with which he carried
out the activities of the Assembly during his mandate.
Similarly, I address my remarks to the Secretary-General,
Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has tenaciously done
everything, to find the very best solutions for the
problems afflicting humanity, pledging to provide our
Organization with the dynamism needed to face future
challenges.
The fiftieth session of the General Assembly, which
coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of
the United Nations, provides us with an opportunity to
engage in profound reflection on the extent to which we
have moved forward towards the realization of its main
goals, inter alia, preservation of international peace and
security, promotion and protection of human rights, and
economic and social development, with a view to looking
more optimistically and more boldly at the challenges
which lie ahead on the eve of the twenty-first century.
In fact, although the changes that took place in the
wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in
international relations and promoted, as never before,
democratic values, the international situation nevertheless
has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the
political, economic, social and financial spheres. Conflicts
of all sorts proliferate, affecting principally the countries
of the so-called third world and creating a climate of
uncertainty as to the future of humankind.
As we approach the twenty-first century, we face
new and greater challenges that will necessitate joint,
12


concerted action by the Members of the United Nations.
This will require a new democratic structure in international
relations, in the broadest sense.
More than ever before, we need to think about the
objectives and role of the United Nations, as set out in the
Charter, and focus on that task.
The process of restructuring the United Nations should
lead the Organization to an arrangement that reflects the
new challenges we face in the world at this time and that
would allow for the broad participation of its Members. We
are convinced that the present structure of the United
Nations — and in particular that of the Security Council —
does not meet the present needs of post-cold-war
international relations. Apart from the restructuring
undertaken in the agencies that coordinate economic and
social development worldwide, priority should be given to
the restructuring of the Security Council, whose
composition continues to be a reflection of the cold war.
The enlargement of the Council should take place with
respect to the categories of permanent and non-permanent
members alike. This will require taking into consideration
the need for geographic balance.
We are also in favour of restructuring the methods of
work of the United Nations so as to make them more
transparent.
Furthermore, it is important to guarantee the
effectiveness of the mechanisms and means of ensuring
implementation of the decisions of United Nations organs.
In recent years, the General Assembly has adopted
numerous resolutions, and important global strategies have
been defined in various forums under the aegis of the
United Nations, aimed at solving problems afflicting all
humankind. These problems range from the living
conditions of children, the environment, human rights,
population problems and social development to, more
recently, the issue of the situation of women, dealt with at
the Beijing Conference.
The time has come to take action. The unsatisfactory
functioning of some of the mechanisms for monitoring the
application of decisions and the weak commitment of States
have been the root cause of the failure to carry out many of
these recommendations.
The world socio-economic situation continues to
deteriorate, particularly in the so-called developing
countries, where many economies are on the verge of
collapse.
Public assistance for development has sunk to
deplorable levels. United Nations agencies involved in
development have seen their budgets severely affected by
the financial crisis, resulting in cuts in numerous
programmes that were destined to help raise development
indicators in various countries. To give just one example,
the annual report of the Secretary-General indicates that
the United Nations Development Programme experienced
a reduction of $1.4 billion in the period 1992-1996.
Structural adjustment programmes undertaken in
various countries have not produced the desired results,
leading to reductions in national funds in the social field.
These negative factors are cumulative, and added to them
is the heavy burden of external debt, whose service alone
consumes a large part of the gross national product of
debtor countries.
Africa’s capacity to repay debt has been negatively
affected not only by weak economic structures inherited
from the past, but also by natural disasters and internal
armed conflicts. In view of this situation, it is necessary
to adopt measures that are more just and less prejudicial,
so that debtor countries can pay their external debt
without hindering their development or requiring further
sacrifices on the part of the poorest segments of their
populations.
The principal international financial institutions
should grant more favourable credit to developing
countries, so that the remedies applied to their respective
economies will not lead to a deterioration of the health of
those economies.
The present international economic order does not
favour the economies of the so-called third world. It is
thus necessary to have a more just international economic
order, without protectionist measures that impede
international business relations and create discrimination
against developing countries, the majority of which
become sources of raw materials and inexpensive labour
and importers of manufactured goods.
The strengthening of south-south cooperation and
regional economic integration will, as we see it, be an
adequate response to this trend. Countries of the southern
region of Africa, to which Angola belongs, have provided
a good example of regional integration, both economic
and political, by forming the Southern African
Development Community (SADC). Given the prospects
for total political stability in the region and its economic
potential, the region may well transform itself into an
13


important development zone. In the same way we value the
joint regional integration between members of the Zone of
Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic, of which
Angola is also a member.
In successive resolutions the General Assembly has
recommended that priority be given to our continent in
terms of aid for development, because it is the region of the
world that has most suffered the tragic effects of
colonialism. But reality shows a significant drop in
resources available for development. This aggravates the
precarious economic situation of African countries that have
no capital and no technology, which increases poverty and
makes them susceptible to serious internal conflict.
If, as we have just indicated, it is true that we are
witnessing, nearly everywhere, some proliferation of
regional conflicts that put peace and international security
at risk, it is also true that in Africa these conflicts have
reached a level of great danger. Not only is the dimension
of such conflicts a source of concern but so is their nature.
Its markedly ethnic, racial or religious character is being
used to justify intentions which place at risk the unity and
territorial integrity of several nations.
The inadmissible genocide that occurred in Rwanda
seriously damaged the values of human dignity and
tolerance. Above all, it demonstrated the need for the
international community to seek new ways and means to
eliminate the focal points of conflict and to guarantee
protection for civilian populations, the people who are the
primary victims of internal conflicts.
In Burundi we are concerned about the deteriorating
internal situation. In this connection the international
community, and the United Nations in particular, should
shoulder their responsibilities in order to help avoid the
repetition in that country of earlier events by supporting by
every means available the efforts carried out by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) mission with a view
to fostering peace and stability.
In Somalia the continuing fratricidal war that is tearing
that society apart is threatening the very existence and
integrity of the country. The international community, and
the United Nations in particular, cannot and should not fail
to shoulder its responsibilities vis-à-vis the people of
Somalia.
We pay tribute to Liberia for the recent developments
in that country, thanks to the recent Abuja peace agreement
between the warring parties. We hope that this agreement
will finally bring lasting peace to the Liberian people.
Concerning Western Sahara, we join our voice to the
voice of the international community in urging the
interested parties to observe the United Nations peace
plan.
Despite its own internal difficulties, the Government
of the Republic of Angola is doing its utmost to support
OAU efforts within the framework of African
mechanisms of prevention, management and resolution of
conflicts. In that context we did not hesitate to make a
contribution to a resolution of the crisis faced by the
people of the Republic of Sao Tome and Principe after
the coup d’état of 15 August. As the Assembly will be
aware, Angolan mediation helped to restore democratic
institutions and constitutional order in that country. We
have acted on behalf of the historic solidarity which links
our two peoples in a common struggle for democratic
liberties and respect for the law of constitutional
institutions.
Thanks to the support provided by the international
community, particularly the Portuguese-speaking
countries, along with the European Union, France and
Portugal in particular, and of course the Secretary-General
of the United Nations, we were able, in a short period of
time, to get an agreement between the parties on 22
August last.
The conflict in the countries of the former
Yugoslavia is one of the most complex conflicts seen in
Europe since the end of the cold war. The Government of
Angola is concerned about this conflict. We support the
current peace initiatives and hope that the meeting
between the parties involved and the mediators will lead
to concrete results, to the satisfaction of the peoples of
the region.
The situation in the Middle East has been marked by
some important and significant developments since the
signing of the agreement between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) and the beginning of the
normalization of bilateral relations among countries of the
region.
Such advances are quite encouraging. We are
confident of a final end to the Arab-Israeli conflict if we
continue to see political will, a constructive spirit and
flexibility demonstrated on all sides. Angola has always
defended the right to self-determination of the people of
14


Palestine and the restitution of the occupied Arab territories.
We here reiterate our support for the peace process that is
under way and express our opposition to acts of violence
intended to call into question the continuation of this
process.
The question of East Timor continues to prick the
conscience of the international community. It is necessary
to ensure that the people of East Timor enjoy the legitimate
right freely to choose its own destiny and that this be
recognized. In this regard the United Nations has an
important responsibility, which it cannot escape.
We are particularly encouraged by the opening of a
dialogue between Portugal and Indonesia. But there will be
positive results only if the interests and options of the
people of the Territory are borne in mind during the search
for a just and acceptable solution.
Angola shares with the people of East Timor a
common past of struggle against Portuguese colonialism.
We will continue to give our utmost to the search for a just
and acceptable solution.
By sustaining an economic, commercial and financial
embargo against Cuba for more than 30 years the United
States of America has created a paradox within the reality
of our times. The embargo is a set-back to international
efforts to eliminate the last relics of the cold war. Angola
therefore reiterates its opposition to this unilateral measure,
whose extraterritorial impact is in violation of international
norms of free trade and international law.
Practice shows that constructive dialogue is the best
solution for resolving differences, similar to that which
occurred in reaching a solution to the problem of migration
between the two countries. We think that it is up to the
people of Cuba freely to decide their own destiny.
Obviously, I cannot refrain from making reference to
the situation in my own country, which will be of interest
to many here. As is known, after long years of war Angola
finally found the path to peace, starting with the signature
of the Lusaka Protocol and the initial steps taken to
implement its provisions. It is an agreement that
complements the fundamental structure of the peace process
established by the Bicesse Accords, which were signed with
the mediation of the Government of Portugal.
Since the signature of the Lusaka document in 1991
and the cease-fire agreed to in November last year, the
situation in our country has evolved significantly, despite
some negative aspects and obstacles that I shall mention
shortly. Major offensive military actions have stopped,
leading to the free movement of people and goods in
many areas of the country under Government control. We
are now seeing the return of thousands of displaced
citizens to their areas of origin.
In the political area, a direct dialogue has begun
between the Government and UNITA, between His
Excellency the President of Angola and Mr. Savimbi.
This has facilitated the resolution of many problems
related to the implementation of the Accords that were
not resolved at Lusaka.
In addition, the Government has taken important
steps to strengthen the climate of mutual trust and to
make reconciliation possible. Within this context, the
Government supported a legislative initiative to modify
the Constitution to accommodate the leader of UNITA as
one of the two Vice-Presidents of the Republic. That
significant political gesture, along with the future
integration of UNITA members in a government of
national unity, will create conditions for Angolans to
enjoy a definitive and lasting peace in a climate of
tolerance, free from hatreds or resentment.
Despite those efforts, which my Government views
as positive, we continue to be concerned by the excessive
delays in the implementation of the peace process, whose
most serious issue is the quartering and demobilization of
UNITA forces, which has not yet been implemented as it
should have been under the Lusaka Accords. This delay
has resulted in some serious recent problems and
incidents in some regions of the country. Such incidents
do not at this time pose a serious threat to peace, but they
are capable of creating dangerous focal points of tension
that call into question the trust that is needed for full
implementation of the Peace Accords.
My Government would like to take this opportunity
to express its gratitude for the work done by the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola. It has by and large
assured respect for the provisions of the Peace Accords
and has involved the presence of many countries
represented here. We believe that the complete
deployment of peace-keeping infantry units will make it
possible better to control the implementation of the
commitments made in Lusaka.
The post-conflict phase in Angola will require urgent
measures of a special economic and social nature in order
to move the country rapidly out of the state of crisis, to
15


rebuild its productive and social infrastructures and to
prevent a return to war, measures which must guarantee the
social reintegration of thousands of military personnel, of
whom some 150,000 are to be demobilized, and the return
of refugees and internally displaced persons who are
returning to their areas of origin.
As I speak, a meeting is being held in Brussels
between my country and the European Community to come
up with an overall plan for national reconciliation. From
this rostrum we should like to express our thanks to all
countries that have assisted us and to all the United Nations
agencies that have made it possible to organize this
important meeting, the first round table meeting in Brussels.
My Government has entered in earnest on to the task of
achieving national reconciliation in our country. As we said
earlier, a community rehabilitation programme has been
created, in collaboration with the United Nations, to this
end. It has a budget of $700 million that will be open to all
donor countries in Brussels with a view, inter alia, to
restoring in the shortest possible time basic production
activity in the 18 provinces of the country.
We are aware that the rapid recovery of the Angolan
economy will depend largely on our success in
implementing this programme and achieving peace and
harmony in our country. It is an economy that saw its gross
national product and per capita income decrease by one half
as a consequence of war. Thus, we would like once again
to request the international community to continue to lend
assistance to Angola in order to achieve complete peace and
reconciliation among all Angolans. We hope that can
become a reality.
"
AGO,2008,"I am 
particularly honoured to address the General Assembly 
on behalf of His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos 
Santos, President of the Republic of Angola. 
 First, I should like, on behalf of my Government, 
to warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto 
Brockmann on his election to preside over this organ. 
We wish him all success during his mandate and assure 
him of the support of my country. 
 The present session of the General Assembly is 
taking place at a time of serious challenges for the 
international community. They include the food crisis, 
the rise in fuel prices, unexpected climate change, the 
financial crisis, the escalation of cold-war rhetoric and 
terrorism. The global scale of those challenges and 
their negative effects on the lives of millions of human 
beings on all continents indicate that we are at a 
critical moment. We must overcome those challenges 
through a collective response, with the central role 
played by the United Nations. Above all, however, 
each State must also act individually. 
 With regard to the financial crisis, we must take 
measures that help to prevent serious effects on the 
global economy, especially the economies of the more 
vulnerable countries. Such measures must be effective 
and must help to reduce the negative impact on the 
progress that African countries have already made by 
implementing reforms that have enabled them to have 
an annual growth rate of 5 per cent.  
 We are also concerned at the rise in food prices. 
That has dealt a hard blow to the efforts to fight 
poverty, which affects more than 1 billion people. The 
rise in food prices is closely linked to climate change, 
which is not only causing the destruction of 
infrastructure and basic means of subsistence in many 
countries, but is also forcing millions of people into 
poverty. 
 The elimination of distorting elements in 
international trade is also fundamental if we are to 
resolve the world food crisis. The agricultural subsidies 
provided by the wealthiest countries to their farmers 
are ruining the farming production in poor countries, 
rendering difficult their farmers’ access to international 
markets. The failure of the World Trade Organization 
negotiations during the Doha Round last July further 
aggravated that scenario. The collapse of those talks 
eliminated the chances of concluding, in the short term, 
a general trade agreement that would remove such 
subsidies and other obstacles to international trade 
exchanges. The Republic of Angola hopes that 
negotiations will resume as soon as possible and that 
the main actors will show the necessary flexibility to 
allow countries that are underprivileged as a result of 
the lack of a global trade agreement to avoid remaining 
eternally marginalized from the global economy. 
 Turning this extremely dangerous situation 
around, particularly for the countries of the South, 
requires that the General Assembly intensify its efforts. 
Our hope is that the President will steer the debate 
towards addressing these concerns. The Republic of 
Angola commits itself to contributing, within the limits 
of its capacity, to finding solutions to these problems 
that affect all States. 
 South-South cooperation, including triangular 
cooperation, has the potential to contribute to the 
eradication of poverty through the establishment of 
partnerships for sustainable development, trade, 
 
 
55 08-52265 
 
investment, tourism, prevention and combating of drug 
trafficking, illicit trade in small arms and light 
weapons, and transnational organized crime. In that 
connection, Angola is honoured to chair the Zone of 
Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic, an 
effective interregional mechanism for cooperation in 
the areas of development, peace and security among its 
24 member States in Africa and South America.  
 I would like to avail myself of the opportunity to 
assure our international partners that the Republic of 
Angola is motivated more than ever to assume the 
responsibilities that arise from membership in the 
institutions of the international community, those of the 
African continent and those of the United Nations. Our 
engagement and commitment will, in the meantime, 
continue to lie primarily in the maintenance of peace 
and security, the consolidation of democracy, respect 
for human rights and sustainable economic 
development, on the basis of the social laws of a 
market economy that will safeguard the interests and 
the satisfaction of the majority of the population. 
 Those are the principles that have guided our 
trajectory as a country, in particular since the end of 
the cold war. A coherent application of those principles 
is the basis for the progress that Angola is building in 
the political, social and economic domains. As a result, 
since 2002, a climate of peace prevails in the entire 
country, with the eradication of conflict factors and 
important advances in national reconciliation, 
emergence of a highly entrepreneurial private sector, a 
dynamic civil society and a free, vibrant and active 
press. 
 In the last five years, Angola has been registering 
high economic growth rates. During this period, the 
gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an estimated 
rate of 14.7 per cent in real terms. The non-oil sector 
grew at a rate of 17.4 per cent, faster than the oil 
sector, which reached an annual growth rate of 12.7 per 
cent. This growth allowed the unemployment rate, 
which in the mid-1990s was estimated to be at 45 per 
cent, to decrease to an estimated level of 22.5 per cent 
in 2007.  
 The relative weight of the extractive industry, 
dominated by the oil and diamond subsectors, grew at a 
significant rate of 61.6 per cent. Moreover, Angola saw 
a reduction in inflation levels from 105.6 per cent in 
December 2003 to 11.78 per cent in December 2007, as 
well as a transformation in public accounts from a 
deficit of 7 per cent of the GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 
11.4 per cent of the GDP in 2007. These figures 
encourage us to be optimistic in relation to the 
implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. 
 On 5 September of this year, Angola added one 
more pillar to its democratic structure by holding 
legislative elections in a transparent and totally free 
environment. Despite the criticism and the pressure on 
the Angolan Government to hold the elections earlier, 
independently of the objective and subjective 
conditions prevailing at the time, the discernment of its 
leader, His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos, 
demonstrated that the elections were held at the most 
appropriate moment. 
 With the gradual yet significant improvement in 
the quality of life of the people, and with fully 
reconciled and peaceful spirits, a climate of tolerance 
and political coexistence emerged into its optimal 
space. The elections were indeed an expression of the 
reaffirmation of our dignity. 
 All the efforts involved in the complex electoral 
process that led to the success of this historic feat were 
made with the human and material resources of the 
Angolan Government. We are proud to once more have 
given a good example of political maturity, civic 
discipline and full popular participation. It gives us joy 
to state before this Assembly that, like other peoples of 
the world, Africans have the capability and the ability 
to build their own destiny and develop participatory 
democracy. 
 Armed conflicts continue to absorb resources 
from both the international community and the parties 
involved, resources that could be better utilized for the 
well-being of the population in affected territories. 
However, for the first time in many years, Africa is 
experiencing a significant reduction in conflict, 
allowing for improved economic indicators. The 
progress in the peace process in Côte d’Ivoire and the 
consolidation of peace under way in Sierra Leone and 
in Liberia have brought about a new aura of hope. 
Furthermore, the progress made in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, despite some tension in the eastern 
areas, is manifestly encouraging. 
 We hope that the efforts currently being made by 
the United Nations and the African Union, as well as 
by regional organizations, will help resolve the 
conflicts in Somalia and Darfur in a peaceful manner. 
  
 
08-52265 56 
 
 As Chair of the Organ on Politics, Defence and 
Security Co-operation of the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC), the Republic of 
Angola has given its all, together with the other 
countries of that region and the facilitator, to support 
the negotiation process with a view ending the political 
crisis in Zimbabwe. Angola welcomes the inter-party 
agreement reached in Zimbabwe and will continue to 
make efforts to help the parties put national interests 
before all personal quarrels so as to ease the return to 
political stability and to reverse the grim economic 
situation that prevails in the country. We appeal to the 
international community, particularly to the European 
Union, to support the programme aimed at overcoming 
the crisis, which will be drawn up by the inclusive 
Government resulting from the inter-party agreement. 
We also call for the subsequent lifting of the sanctions 
imposed on that country. 
 However, we must remain vigilant to the 
possibility of the eruption of new conflicts due to the 
political instability that exists in other countries of the 
continent. We must invest in preventive diplomacy and 
in the strengthening of rapid alert mechanisms.  
 In the Middle East, the latest developments seem 
to introduce a light at the end of the tunnel, with regard  
to a definitive resolution of the Palestinian and the 
Israeli-Arab issues. Angola encourages the parties 
involved to engage in a dialogue that will lead to the 
de facto and de jure establishment of a Palestinian 
State, with recognized borders, coexisting side by side 
with Israel. 
 My Government maintains its solidarity with the 
Common African Position and with all those who 
advocate the need to democratize the United Nations 
and to reform its system, including the expansion of 
the Security Council so that it reflects a fair and 
equitable regional representation, with all the rights 
inherent in membership. 
 I would not like to end my statement without 
once again conveying my regret to the General 
Assembly over the continuation of the embargo that the 
Republic of Cuba is subjected to by the United States 
of America. It constitutes a situation that does not 
comply with the rules that govern relations between 
States. We are in an age of peaceful coexistence among 
peoples and nations, and that embargo wounds the 
universal collective conscience of our time. "
AGO,1992,"Allow me, first of all, on behalf 
of the Angolan Government and on my own behalf, to congratulate you. Sir, on 
your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh 
session and to wish you success in carrying out your mandate. I am sure that 
your experience and competence will guarantee the success of our work. The 
Angolan delegation wishes from the outset to assure you of our complete 
cooperation. 
To the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi, I should 
like to express my appreciation for the valuable work done during his mandate. 
To Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I express my Government's 
profound appreciation of his goodwill and selfless efforts, demonstrated in 
the constant search for just and lasting solutions aimed at preserving peace 
and international security. 
My Government supports and will contribute in a positive way to the 
realization of the valuable concepts formulated in his report ""An Agenda for 
Peace"", whose sub-heading includes the words ""Preventive diplomacy"" (A/47/277). 
On behalf of the Government and people of Angola, I wish to welcome the 
new States that have been admitted to the United Nations; we are certain that 
their participation will contribute to the Organization's betterment. 
The world has witnessed important political transformations occurring in 
Angola in the past. The armed conflict that had ravaged the country since 
1975 was ended with the signing of the Bicesse Accords on 31 May 1992. There 
 
83 
is no occasion more appropriate than the present one to sum up the situation 
which has followed the peace accords. The Angolan people is preparing for and 
awaiting with great expectations the holding of the first multiparty general 
elections on 29 and 30 September, which demonstrate my Government's 
determination to comply with the obligations it has assumed under the Bicesse 
Accords. 
While the incidents taking place in my country represent transitional 
occurrences in a process as complex as ours, their recurrence in almost all 
parts of the country is a source of grave concern to my Government and to the 
Angolan people. In this regard my Government believes that the United Nations 
and the rest of the international community have an important role to play 
during this decisive phase of the Angolan peace process. 
The environment of peace and relative tranquillity that prevails in my 
country is the result of persistent and arduous work and of the tenacious will 
of the Angolan people, which counted upon the international community. The 
Angolan people has provided proof of civilian rule and political maturity by 
spontaneously and massively participating in electoral registration and in all 
the activities which will bring about the elections in spite of the difficulty 
in communications. 
Of the estimated number of slightly more than 5 million voters, 
4.8 million have registered. The national electoral council has demonstrated 
foresight and has performed its work with praiseworthy efficiency. And from 
this podium, I wish to express once more Angola's appreciation to all those 
countries and organizations which lent us their support in so many forms. 
My Government sincerely hopes that before the election definitive accords 
can be reached on certain aspects which continue to be a source of concern 
with regard to the conduct of free and fair elections at the end of this 
 
84-85 
month. I am speaking, in particular, of the disbanding of the present 
governmental armed forces and the military wing of UNITA, of the cessation of 
the wave of violence and intimidation provoked by the Government's 
co-signatory to the Bicesse Accords and of the formation of a national army. 
The process of peace and democratization under way in my country, to 
which I have previously referred as a historic event in the life of Angola, 
cannot but have positive repercussions and effects in the international 
sphere. Associated with this is another factor of profound significance for 
the southern region of our continent. I am referring to the negotiations 
being conducted in South Africa within the framework of the Convention for a 
Democratic South Africa (CODESA), which Angola considers the most appropriate 
means to find a fair, lasting and satisfactory solution for all the parties 
involved. 
As a result, Angola supports and shares the African position that CODESA 
should achieve concrete objectives, such as the establishment of a 
transitional government and the creation of mechanisms for elaborating a 
constitution for a democratic South Africa and for holding free elections 
based on the principle of ""one person, one vote"". 
 
86 
I should like also to make reference to the situation in Mozambique and 
in other parts of the African continent. The Angolan people stand in 
solidarity with our brethren in Mozambique. For that reason, my Government 
encourages the Government of Mozambique to persevere in its peace effort for 
the country and urges the international community to give its assistance to 
the parties involved with a view to achieving peace and national 
reconciliation. 
Another question that still worries us is the unjust situation that 
persists in East Timor. The position of the Angolan Government is well known 
by all; we continue to defend the principle of direct negotiations between 
Portugal, as the administering Power, and Indonesia, without excluding the 
presence of the legitimate representatives of the Maubere people, so that a 
comprehensive solution can be found, taking into consideration the aspirations 
of the Maubere people. In this context, we express our wish that the next 
meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and Portugal, under 
the auspices of the Secretary-General, will produce positive results. 
In relation to Western Sahara, my Government supports the holding of a 
referendum in that Territory and sincerely hopes that the obstacles that still 
exist will be removed as soon as possible. 
Angola looks with concern to the situation which prevails in the former 
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, where the short-term outlook for 
reaching a lasting peace is poor, and where the lives of innocent people are 
being taken. 
In relation to the Middle East, the Angolan Government has always 
favoured holding an international conference to reach a comprehensive solution 
on the Middle East, in particular the Palestinian question. Therefore, we 
support the rounds of negotiations that are taking place; we hope that 
although there are many obstacles to overcome, the concerted efforts and the 
good will of the parties will bring positive results and that the tragedy of 
the Palestinian people will finally end. 
A fact which cannot but bring us satisfaction and which has our total 
support and encouragement is the holding of direct negotiations between Israel 
and the other parties concerned on the occupied Arab territories. We hope 
that those negotiations will yield fully satisfactory results for the parties 
participating in the negotiations, and that peace will finally be restored in 
the region. 
In our view, whatever measure is taken, or whatever solution is advised, 
will never be satisfactory or lasting unless it takes into account and is 
based upon the true interests and concerns of the peoples involved. 
The great changes that have recently taken place in the international 
arena have in a certain way dictated the necessity of providing our 
Organization with greater dynamism in taking decisions and greater efficiency 
in implementing and monitoring them. 
The increase in the membership of the Organization, while strengthening 
it numerically, has also created the need for greater participation, on an 
equitable basis, in the various agencies of the United Nations system which 
bear mandates of fundamental importance in resolving the affairs of mankind 
with respect to problems of peace, international security, development and 
environmental protection.

We hope that the work under way for the restructuring and revitalization 
of the United Nations will take our needs into consideration. Angola 
considers such restructuring to be opportune provided it is directed towards 
eliminating mechanisms for taking action that are outdated or are no longer 
attuned to the present reality, and provided that the restructuring has as its 
fundamental objective the strengthening of the role of the Organization to the 
benefit of all mankind. 
In recent decades the world economic situation has swung widely in 
various corners of the planet. But the general trend has been towards 
polarization. As a result, while we observe an increase in economic growth 
for the developed countries, we note a substantial decrease in growth for 
developing countries. The situation in some cases is critical. 
The second Conference of the Least Developed Countries, held at Paris in 
September 1990, concluded that the economic and social situation of those 
countries as a whole has deteriorated over the past decade, since, with very 
rare cases of better performance, the average annual growth rate was 
2.2 per cent. In many cases the rates were negative. 
Faced with this sad reality, the Conference set forth a new programme of 
action for the present decade which provides for national and international 
measures in favour of these countries and indicates the basic principles which 
must orient relations between those countries and other countries and 
organizations which cooperate with them for development. In each case, 
effective implementation of that programme will require serious and profound 
reflection, and commensurate action. 
 
89 
With the end of the cold war, a new era has begun in which decisions on 
matters of world interest are dealt with more and more on the basis of 
consultation and understanding, instead of confrontation and competition. 
This has rapidly transformed isolated cases of integration into a general 
trend, with countries in various regions organizing themselves into more 
closely aligned economic and political entities. 
This trend towards the formation of larger economic blocs will inevitably 
transform the world economically and politically. This poses a challenge for 
which we must be duly prepared in order to avoid deepening still further the 
gap that separates rich countries from poor countries. It is a challenge with 
respect to which all of us, rich countries and poor, large countries and 
small, must make a commensurate collective effort to maintain effective, 
multifarious international cooperation directed always towards the development 
of the parties involved, based always upon the true needs of the development 
process. 
However, certain political situations are now viewed as faits accomplis. 
or as conditions to be perpetuated. These must be the object of immediate and 
radical revision, with a view to harmonizing positions and interests, and 
weakening wide barriers that impede true cooperation between countries and 
nations separated by vast differences in their levels of economic, social, 
scientific, technical, cultural and educational development. 
In our view, this revision should consist, inter alia, of the following 
elements: abolition of protectionist measures by developed countries that 
block or impede access to their markets for products from underdeveloped 
 
90 
countries, or their limitation to those that are strictly necessary; total or 
partial cancellation by the developed countries of the underdeveloped 
countries' external debt; in the granting of loans or credits, the imposition 
of no further conditions with respect to concomitant, mandatory adoption of 
political measures that are not always in keeping with the level of 
development of the beneficiary country; concessions or an increase in grace 
periods, and rescheduling of payment; a reduction of interest rates and the 
non-capitalization of interest; favouring of investments in nationally defined 
areas, with particular emphasis on industrial development; and transformation 
of technology and its application to development. 
Those are some of the basic aspects around which the strategy of 
international economic cooperation must revolve if we intend, as is our duty, 
to eliminate the poverty in which the majority of the inhabitants of our 
planet languish. Poverty grows daily, especially in our African continent. 
It is worsened by natural calamities that exacerbate the present grave 
economic and social situation in Africa. 
 
91 
Angola is a country with many natural resources. It exports petroleum, 
diamonds, coffee and other products, and with the advent of peace we intend to 
diversify fully our export products, in this manner participating more 
effectively in the division of international labour. 
However, we are concerned by the exaggerated protectionist measures 
practised by developed countries in international trade, which are manifest in 
the unprecedented drop in the prices of raw materials and in the deterioration 
of the terms of trade, as well as the lack of success in the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiation rounds. 
As a third world country, and with the objective of correcting the 
distortion in its economy, Angola reformulated its socio-political situation 
with measures which will necessarily have positive effects on the economic 
life of the country and which are consonant with this new situation. We 
recently adopted a Government programme of action designed to decentralize the 
economy, liberalize trade, revitalize business, democratize the banking sector 
and encourage foreign investment. 
In this manner, we believe that adequately carrying out this programme in 
response to these new conditions will permit us, as is our desire, to 
participate actively in international economic cooperative efforts, making our 
contribution, to the extent possible, to the socio-economic development of 
Africa and the world. 
Allow me to express here my country's profound interest in the need to 
protect the environment. The Rio Conference, held in June this year, not only 
constituted a means for an interesting exchange of experiences and viewpoints 
concerning a most important programme but also provided a moment for 
reflection on the continuing need for coordinated efforts for the benefit of 
 
92 
all mankind. Most certainly, the Conference allowed us to see clearly that, 
given current trends in scientific and technical development, any brash 
misstep detrimental to the environment could lead to the destruction of our 
planet. 
I wish for this reason to reaffirm here my country's commitment to 
observe and fully apply the decisions of the Conference and to express our 
readiness to engage in unrestricted cooperation with the international 
community in undertaking all necessary steps so that we, together, can save 
the Earth. 
"
AGO,2003,"﻿I would like
to start by congratulating Mr. Julian Hunte on his
33

election to the presidency of the General Assembly at
its fifty-eight session. We wish him great success in the
fulfilment of this difficult and lofty task.
The current session is taking place at one of the
most troubled times in our era. The recent events in the
Gulf region were a severe test of the capacity and
readiness of the United Nations to provide appropriate
responses to the challenges presently faced by the
international community. The impact of these events
somehow diminished the cohesion of our world
Organization and weakened trust among its Members.
There was a failure in the international security system,
which puts us in the position of needing immediately to
make it more effective.
In fact, the present international security system,
created after the last great war — despite having to
date prevented the outbreak of a new world conflict —
has shown signs of an incompatibility in the global
collective security interests of the Members of the
United Nations in relation to the new challenges of this
millennium.
We are in urgent need of an integrated system
capable of dealing effectively with the major threats to
international stability at the outset of this twenty-first
century, specifically terrorism and international
organized crime; weapons of mass destruction; internal
conflicts, which, unfortunately, continue to plague the
African continent in particular; generalized poverty;
and HIV/AIDS.
Terrorism is today the most direct threat to the
security of our countries, as can be seen from the attacks
that in the past two years have killed thousands of
civilians in the United States, Russia, Africa and Asia.
With regard to armed conflicts, the situation
continues to require urgent attention. During the last
decade, approximately one third of African States were
either directly or indirectly affected by internal conflicts,
which resulted in costs as high as $15 billion a year, and
caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, massive
displacements of people, famine and malnutrition, and
the spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS.
The prevalence of conflicts in Africa is not only
the result of the divisions inherited from the post-
colonial period and the cold war and of ethnic and
religious differences. It is also a consequence of factors
such as the fragility of national institutions, the
marginalization of the African continent from the
world economy, the illegal exploitation of natural
resources and the resulting arms proliferation, and the
weak monitoring of national borders. This situation
must be swiftly reversed, since it can endanger the
future of millions of Africans and increase the risk of
certain areas of the continent’s becoming true
sanctuaries for terrorist organizations.
Improving United Nations political institutions
and security systems constitutes the most effective
method of addressing the threats facing humankind. It
is therefore necessary to establish new mechanisms
outside of the traditional strategic doctrines. The
international legal documents created by the United
Nations, and the current alliances between States, have
proved insufficient to respond adequately and in a
consensual manner to such threats, particularly when they
are posed by entities that are not themselves States.
Because of its universal nature, the United
Nations plays a central role in the management of
current and future challenges. But that is not enough. It
is crucial that that role be performed within a more
democratic and participative framework, particularly
with regard to major decisions on international peace
and security.
Iraq and other parts of the Middle East are the
main hotbeds of tension in the world today, and the
combined efforts of the United Nations are being
focused on that region. The continued loss of life in
Iraq — with most of those killed being innocent
civilians, including United Nations officials, among
them the late Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Sergio Vieira de Mello — is a reminder of the
need for increased support by the international
community to ensure the security of the Iraqi people,
the building of new institutions and the beginning of
the reconstruction of the country.
The will of the international community, and
certainly that of the Iraqi people, is for Iraq to become,
as soon as possible, a viable, democratic State with
institutions validated by its people, and a country living
in peace with its neighbours.
The achievement of this goal implies the
establishment of a political and institutional framework
in which the United Nations plays an active role,
specifically in the pacification and unification of the
country; in the internal political dialogue; in the
process of national reconciliation; and in the
establishment of new democratic institutions.
34

Angola hopes that the present convergence of
positions among the members of the Security Council
on the role of the United Nations in Iraq will facilitate
an understanding relative to the transitional process in
general and to the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi
people.
Angola deplores the loss of civilian life and the
material damage caused by the escalation of the
conflict in the Middle East. The rekindling of violence
between Palestinians and Israelis represents the
greatest danger to the implementation of the road map
for peace, whose ultimate objective is the signing of an
agreement for the creation of an independent, viable
Palestinian State, living side by side and in peace with
Israel and its other neighbours. In our view, that is the
only solution capable of putting a definite end to the
cycle of violence.
The end, last year, of the armed conflict in
Angola, and the success of the peace process, are
among the most extraordinary political achievements
seen in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. With the
attainment of peace in Angola, the Southern African
region became, for the first time in several decades, a
zone free from conflict, and it can now focus its human
and material resources on reconstruction and
development efforts.
Angola today is a country in its post-conflict
stage. It is committed to the tasks of overcoming the
heavy burden of a 40-year conflict, focusing on the
strengthening of its democratic process — which even
during the difficult war period was never abandoned by
the Government — and fully resuming its legitimate
role within the regional and international context.
As a result of the impact of the conflict on the
human, economic, social and financial structures of the
country, and given the inequities inherited from our
colonial past, the current post-conflict stage — which
will lead to the building of a new society in Angola —
is a difficult and painful one, and this has been an
obvious impediment to an immediate response to the
legitimate aspirations of Angolan citizens.
The challenges that confront Angola are enormous
— perhaps immeasurable. The main challenges include
the resettlement of more than 4 million displaced
persons and 450,000 refugees; the social reintegration
of more than 80,000 former military personnel and
their respective families; the resolution of the problem
of absolute poverty, which now afflicts more than half
of the Angolan population; and the reconstruction of
the social and economic infrastructure.
At the same time, in spite of the scarcity of
available resources, we are creating the necessary
conditions to hold elections in the near future. Despite
our numerous problems and challenges, there is hardly
any assistance from the international community for
Angola, as compared with other countries in similar
circumstances, some of which received an immediate
response to their appeals, even though they lacked de
jure institutions. We would like to believe that such
treatment is not the result of any form of discrimination
against our country.
There is no example in modern history of a State,
rich or poor, that, in the aftermath of a devastating and
destructive war such as that which afflicted Angola,
has managed to overcome the burden left by such a war
and rise again without outside assistance. In Angola,
this reconstruction effort has, up to now, been borne
solely by the Angolans themselves, in spite of the
reiterated promises that the only factor that hindered
the supply of aid to our reconstruction was the
pacification of our country.
We hereby renew, therefore, our appeal to the
international community to help Angola in its domestic
reconstruction effort. To this end, my delegation will
submit a draft resolution on international assistance
and the reconstruction and economic development of
Angola, which proposes that an international donor
conference be convened. We are counting on the
support of the Assembly.
Angola also welcomes the progress made in the
area of peace and security in other regions of the
continent, especially the Democratic Republic of
Congo. The role of Angola, as well as that of its
partners, was crucial in preventing a situation of chaos
and disintegration in the territory of that brotherly
country, with which we share a long border, and in
convincing the parties to give up war and choose
instead a negotiated political solution.
The Congolese patriots have shown signs of great
maturity in guaranteeing the success of the peace process
and the transformation of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo into a viable country that does not constitute a
threat to the stability of its border regions.
Angola will continue to be open to strengthening
the traditional relations of friendship and cooperation it
35

has maintained with the authorities of the interim
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
as well as with future authorities that are legitimately
elected by popular vote.
There is still a stalemate with regard to the
situation in the Western Sahara. Difficulties regarding
the holding of a referendum on the self-determination
of the territory are a hindrance to the search for a
definitive solution to this question. Angola urges the
parties involved to show flexibility and seek a political
solution that enables the people of that territory to
decide freely about their own destiny.
Today, as one part of the world, particularly the
industrialized countries, enjoys considerable wealth, 40
per cent of the 600 million Africans continue to survive
on less than one dollar a day. In fact, Africa continues
to show the lowest social and economic development
indicators, and those levels are becoming even worse, due
to the marginalization of the African countries in the
progress of globalization and within the world economy,
where trade and capital share are only 1 per cent.
Africa is also the continent that benefits the least
in terms of foreign direct investment, receiving only 7
per cent of the investment targeted at the developing
countries. External debt has been a huge obstacle to the
development process because repayment of the debt
service alone has depleted the already-limited national
resources of the African States. Angola supports the
cancellation of the external debt service of the least
developed countries, particularly those in the African
continent.
The macroeconomic measures imposed by the
Bretton Woods institutions within the framework of the
structural adjustment programme have not always been
able to help the African continent overcome its
international economic problems. In many cases, that
has led to controversial results. Based on such results,
experience has shown that, in fact, the financial
institutions very often do not take into account the
idiosyncrasies of each country and frequently put the
Governments in the position of choosing between
meeting the conditions imposed by the financial
institutions or meeting the real needs of their people.
Angola hopes that, with the establishment of the
African Union and the launching of the New
Partnership for Africa’s Development, the tragic
situation in which the African continent finds itself
today can be alleviated by setting priorities and giving
special attention to immediate economic development
issues.













"
AGO,2018,"The General Assembly is holding its seventy-third session at a special moment as we pay tribute to two towering
 
figures of world politics, both sons of Africa: Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan.
Today, exactly one year since my inauguration as President of the Republic of Angola, I have the honour, on behalf of the Angolan people, to  address  from  this rostrum for the first time the entire international community, represented here by its highest dignitaries. I salute the Heads of State and Government present here, as well as the leaders of the various international organizations and bodies, whom I believe to be working directly for the future of our planet.
I take this opportunity  to thank the entire international community for its  support  for  peace and reconciliation in my country, Angola. I also offer my particular gratitude to the United Nations for the decisive role it played in  establishing  lasting  peace in Angola through two peace missions — the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola — and for the important work of its specialized agencies, funds and programmes, in particular UNICEF and the World Food Programme.
We also believe that Angola’s experience in building peace and pursuing reconciliation between parties in conflict has served as a positive example for the United Nations, providing useful insights for approaching peace processes in other parts of the world. Angola has unique experience in building and maintaining lasting peace, continuously deepening national reconciliation, social inclusion and mutual forgiveness, and healing the wounds of the armed conflict, which ended almost 16 years ago.
We gather in the General Assembly  to  discuss and resolve the most serious problems and conflicts that threaten the very survival of humankind. I am referring to the hunger and poverty that affect millions of citizens around the world, global warming and its consequences, mass migration and especially illegal migration, trafficking in drugs, in human organs, and in children and women for forced prostitution, religious intolerance and extremism, terrorism, inter-ethnic armed conflicts, war among nations or even the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Established 73 years ago with the declared purpose of restoring universal peace and harmony,
conferring equal rights on nations large and small,  and establishing a world  of  cooperation,  progress and well-being, the United Nations is still far from achieving the goals enshrined in its Charter. While it is true that, immediately following that establishment, the immediate polarization of the planet into two antagonistic political and economic systems hindered the operationalization of principles favouring international peace and security, it would be unfair to deny that the United Nations has played a commendable role in ending colonialism, promoting human rights, supporting international development and cooperation, and managing and containing flashpoints of tension around the world.
Despite the progress made to date, we must acknowledge the long-standing conflicts yet to be settled, such as that between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East, which can be resolved only through a solution based on two States living peacefully side by side, as advocated by the United Nations and the overwhelming majority of its Member States.
We welcome the recent efforts of the United States of America, North Korea and South Korea, with the contribution of the People’s Republic of China, towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which has considerably reduced tensions that threatened to trigger a nuclear conflict that would endanger not only the region but international security in general.
With the end of the so-called Cold War, symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the momentous emergence of a new political paradigm oriented towards multilateralism, the United Nations eagerly resumed its work towards building a peaceful world order. We believe that, by working diligently together, we can achieve this goal.
Today, in a time of ascendant globalization, there is no justification for the continued proliferation of apparently unresolvable conflicts of varying scale in several parts of the world, or for entire populations to continue suffering their tragic consequences, virtually abandoned to their fate. It is against  this backdrop that many voices are demanding profound reform of the United Nations so that it can better reflect today’s world, where the emergence of new centres of economic and financial power and technological and scientific advances fully justify changes to the Organization’s structures and intervention mechanisms, as well  as the enlargement and reform of the Security Council
 
to better represent the various geopolitical regions of our planet.
The  political  configuration  of   today’s   world, in which local, regional and intra-State conflicts represent the principal focus of international tensions and threats to peace, requires the United Nations to play an increasingly active role in promoting and assisting  political, social  and  economic  processes of democratization. This is the best way to resolve conflicts,  be  they  domestic, international,   ethnic or religious, which in most cases arise as a result of policies of authoritarianism or exclusion, intolerance, radicalism or interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. International terrorism, transnational organized crime, illegal immigration, xenophobia, trafficking in people and in drugs, and other scourges have today reached new proportions, affecting the quality of life of the inhabitants of the planet and calling for coordination at the highest level among all States Members of our Organization.
The seventy-third session of the General Assembly is being held under the theme “Making the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. The United Nations should therefore attach priority to promoting and upholding human rights and strive to solve humankind’s global problems — such as those relating to security, the environment, reducing inequality between the rich and the poor, and development — with a view to safeguarding world peace. We advocate the decentralization of the global financial system, based both on the promotion of trade and regional economic integration systems, and the enhancement of regional financial institutions on terms that allow for more sustainable economic development.
Throughout our history as an independent country, our cooperation with the United Nations has always been a constant; it has helped us not only to relaunch our economy, but also to engage in seeking to build peace, democracy and development in southern and central Africa. The Republic of Angola stands ready to continue supporting all efforts to promote cooperation among all nations of the world in building peace and strengthening cooperation, trade and investment relations at the bilateral and multilateral levels.
"
AGO,1985,"Allow me, in the first place, to express to you. Sir, my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are sure that the choice is intended not only as a symbolic tribute to your country but also as a way of expressing appreciation for your qualities as an experienced diplomat, one who has always firmly asserted your connection with the ideals of peace, equality and understanding among the peoples and nations of today's international community. We wish to express to you our best wishes for your success in the accomplishment of your important task and our conviction that your responsibilities will be performed in an exemplary manner, and with dignity.
We wish also to express our heartfelt esteem to the outgoing President, Ambassador Paul Lusaka, for the clear-headed and dignified way in which he carried his mandate throughout the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly, for praiseworthy professional qualities, which dignify both his own country and Africa as a whole, and for the important role he has always played within the African community in making a most positive contribution to the cause of African unity.
We would like to reiterate to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, our deep appreciation and admiration for his efforts directed to the attainment of the objectives of the United Nations, giving heed to the concerns of all peoples and nations, small and large, and thus helping to bring about just resolutions of disputes and conflicts which threaten international peace and security in different parts of tho world. We very much appreciate his example of courage and unselfish dedication.
I would like to join with the countries which have already delivered their message here and, on behalf of His Excellency President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and of the Government and people of the People's Republic of Angola, to assure the Mexican people of our sympathy and solidarity and to express our condolences to the bereaved families who lost loved ones in the 19-21 September earthquakes. We trust that, with the support of the international community, the Mexican people will, as in the past, be able to overcome this hardship.
The world is currently experiencing growing international tension created by militaristic policies and the belligerent practices of imperialism, which sustain the escalation of the uncurbed arms race in all forms, including nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, thus irrefutably increasing the risk of nuclear war.
The People's Republic of Angola thinks that the States which possess nuclear arms, together with those equipped with massive weaponry, should negotiate the achievement of effective measures conducive to an immediate reduction of their armaments expenditure. The adoption of specific measures towards disarmament should save considerable resources that could be used directly for the improvement of the critical economic and social situation in developing countries. The forthcoming meeting of the top Soviet and American dignitaries will constitute an opportunity to examine possible paths towards a new era in the universe, with more concern and renewed hope in relation to the problems of peace and co-operation for the benefit of all, and the establishment of a new, and more just and equitable, international economic order.
The People's Republic of Angola acknowledges the significance and importance of the environment and of science in terms of Antartica's potential, and reaffirms the need to extend co-operation to the Antarctic region without discrimination and for the good of all mankind. In our view, Antartica should continue to be used exclusively for pacific ends.
The current international economic scenario is characterized by a profound crisis whose causes are rooted in the present structure of international economic relations, which is based on inequality and dependence, with disastrous consequences for the economic situation of developing countries in particular. While world commerce registered an increase of 9 per cent the developing countries were experiencing a recession in their economies because of the manipulation of the terms of trade, a fall in commodity prices, protectionist measures and increased interest rates, which made it difficult for those countries to retain their international solvency and consequently the stability of their balance of payments.
A number of other factors are responsible for the worsening of the economic situation in the developing countries, particularly those of the African region. An unprecedented famine crisis can be witnessed today in our continent, with hunger and poverty striking a large number of people. The situation is made worse, on the one hand, by the poor technological capacity for the prevention of the effects of natural disaster, as in the case of land impoverishment, drought or hurricanes; and, on the other hand, by the lack of realistic action in implementation of development programs, which consequently become impracticable.
In 1984 African countries faced an external debt amounting to $158 billion, and in the current year estimates show an increase of 3 per cent even if restrictive measures are adopted by some of them in order to cut it down. The solutions to be adopted must necessarily focus on modern technology transfer, which can generate increased agricultural development, and implementation of an industrialization process for the transformation of the exportable basic products of those countries.
There is therefore a need for joint action to find appropriate forms of economic and financial co-operation in order to overcome the current debt situation. We consequently reaffirm our support of the decision of the Heads of State of the countries members of the Organization of African Unity which stressed the need for an international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of debtor and creditor countries, on reform of the international monetary system.
In the context of the importance of economic development being accompanied by social development, we laud and fully support the global initiative on the immunization of all children by 1990, a worthy endeavor in which Governments and United Nations agencies are co-operating. Taken in the context of the current international political scene, the situation in southern Africa is becoming more and more alarming in view of the increasing hostility of the illegal apartheid regime of terror, whose existence constitutes an offense to the world conscience and a threat to international peace and security.
We are today seized of yet another open invasion of the People's Republic of Angola by South African regular armed forces. In fact, neither the earlier resolutions of the Security Council nor Security Council resolution 571 (1985), of 29 October 1985, have been implemented, because of the arrogant intransigence of racist South Africa.
From 30 September until now, new bombing attacks and the occupation of parts of our territory have taken place, as stated in the text of the message by the President of the People's Republic of Angola addressed to His Excellency the Secretary-General of the united Nations from which I quote:
""I would like to inform you that the security conditions in south-east Angola continue to deteriorate dangerously as a result of the growing interference of South African armed forces in the internal affairs of Angola and of the direct involvement of the South African armed forces in aggressive military actions against the Angolan people and its sovereign nation.
""In addition to the air raids of 17 September and the intervention of battalion Buffalo in military operations against the Angolan forces, which the Angolan Government condemned and denounced at the time, pointing out the material damage and the loss of human lives caused, I am herewith reporting a new South African offensive, with the intervention of military forces whose number has not yet been determined and which were landed in the territory of the People's Republic of Angola from Namibia, the territory illegally occupied by South Africa. These forces are located in the vicinity of Mavinga, 250 kilometers from the Namibian border, and they have already launched several aggressive actions against our military units using Mirage aircraft and taking advantage of the lesser experience of our pilots in areas far away from their runways. Specifically, the treacherous, murderous attacks took place as described below just as our ground forces were breaking through the third and last defense line of the UNITA puppets as they entered Mavinga town: first, on 28 September five South African planes flew over locations where our forces were positioned between 9.50 and 5.48; secondly, on 29 September the South African planes flew again for lengthy periods over the locations where our troops were positioned; thirdly, in the early morning hours of 30 September, between 3 and 6.20, a formation of more than eight planes from the South African air force raided our positions and caused more than 50 casualties among our troops, as well as dozens of wounded men, and brought down six Angolan helicopters.
""In addition, our infantry soldiers clashed with South African armed forces in direct combat.""
It can be verified that South African artillery units are in Angola to attack our armed forces which have been engaged in the establishment of peace and security in that region of our country. The pretext presented by racist South Africa does not convince anybody any more, not even those who defend the policy of constructive engagement.
South Africa does not respect the most fundamental principles of international law- Pretoria's soldiers make incursions into areas of my country that have never sheltered Namibian refugees. This was the case in Cabinda, where United States oil interests could have been harmed if it had not been for the prompt intervention of the Angolan defense forces, which neutralized the special racist commando unit whose mission it was to destroy the Malongo oil installation in Cabinda, a province situated more than 2,000 kilometers from the Namibian-Angolan border.
The actual situation is characterized by the direct intervention of the South African army against Angola with the objective of defending the puppets of the so-called UNITA, long since denounced as the South African army's surrogates, whose objective is to destabilize Angola.
On the other hand, the apartheid regime is doing everything possible to extend violence across the whole region in order to divert the attention of the international community from the serious situation in South Africa, where the black majority and other groups are determined to end a system that is inconceivable in the 20th century.
The South African regime is the main cause of the tension and destabilization experienced by the States in southern Africa. South Africa continues to violate the resolutions of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, with the help of certain Western countries. The recent statement made by the united States Secretary of State before this General Assembly is a clear demonstration of the encouragement given to South Africa to pursue the policy of destabilization in our region. It is now high time for the Reagan Administration to demonstrate without ambiguity on whose side it stands: on the side of the sovereign States of southern Africa Members of this Organization or on the side of the apartheid regime, which is condemned by the international community, including a growing number of American citizens. The Government of Pretoria cannot prevent the liberation of the Namibian people by a facade of alterations, declarations of states of emergency or the blackmailing of neighboring countries.
With regard to my country, there is no civil war in Angola. Rather, there is permanent aggression orchestrated by Pretoria, and joined by a group of ambitious Angolan traitors motivated by anti-patriotic, tribal and racial interests.
The Government of the People's Republic of Angola follows a policy of unity oriented towards the integration of all its citizens without discrimination. He reject categorically the pretended reconciliation with armed factions manipulated by and acting on behalf of the apartheid regime.
When Pretoria claims that the climate of tension and aggression created in southern Africa is a regional expression of the East-West conflict, that is nothing more titan a justification of the reinforcement of the military aid it has been receiving to impose its political and economic diktat by force of arms on the independent countries of the region which do not conform to its political system.
The Cuban troops are in Angola at the request of the People's Republic of Angola under an agreement subscribed to by two sovereign and independent States.
As the international community knows, South African racist troops are illegally occupying the Territory of Namibia. Thus, the Cuban presence in Angola* which South Africa considers to be an obstacle to peace in southern Africa, is on the contrary a guarantee of stability and peace against Pretoria's expansionist designs. But in spite of the ambiguity and dishonesty of some of our partners, we are willing to pursue our efforts to achieve peace in southern Africa.
Our country has followed with a certain apprehension the evolution of the situation in other points of the African continent, for instance in Chad, where its people is in the midst of a serious crisis caused by multiple acts of foreign interference. We are therefore happy that the OAU is continuing indefatigably its efforts in favor of independence and national unity and to bring about a constructive dialog between the parties involved.
As far as Western Sahara is concerned, we think that the development of direct negotiations between the parties and the holding of a referendum so that the Sahraouri people can exercise their right to self-determination, in conformity with OAU resolution 104 and General Assembly resolution 39/40, are the instruments for the settlement of the dispute.
As for the Middle East, we must point out that the Palestinian issue remains the core of the crisis in the Middle East. Just and lasting peace cannot be achieved without recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian Arab people to return to their homeland and establish an independent, sovereign State on its own national territory.
To that end, and in conformity with the recommendations of the Geneva Declaration on Palestine, we think that the holding of an international conference on the Middle East, with the participation of the parties involved, namely the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and permanent members of the Security Council, would certainly help create a climate of peace and stability in the region.
Meanwhile, very recently, in open defiance of the international community, Israeli armed forces committed an aggressive act against Tunisia, once again showing its true terrorist nature by presenting the most fallacious arguments to justify that criminal action. We vehemently condemn this aggressive act.
In the Persian Gulf we continue to witness an escalation of the war between two brother countries, both members of the Non-Aligned Movement, the consequences of which are tragic in terms not only of loss of human life but also of the destruction of economic infrastructures. We therefore strongly urge the belligerent parties to seek a peaceful, just and honorable solution, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, in order to restore peace, security and stability to the region.
In Central America aggressive action by imperialist forces is ever present. A constant threat hovers over Nicaragua and we regret that certain countries of the region have taken a hostile position in relation to Nicaragua, helping the United States in actions aimed at destabilizing that sovereign country, a Member of the United Nations and a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, through terrorist and armed forces.
The People's Republic of Angola supports Nicaragua in its struggle to maintain its territorial integrity and its efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement of the Central American conflict. Our country also fully supports the peace efforts of the Contadora Group.
The People's Republic of Angola urges all States in South-East Asia to co-operate in order to avoid new threats to peace and security in the region, and to adopt measures to create favorable conditions for permanent, balanced and harmonious relations among the countries of the region, in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence, respect for sovereignty and national independence, territorial integrity and non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states.
In East Timor, we understand that progress is being made, through dialog between Portugal and Indonesia,, with the mediation of the Secretary-General. We trust that the legitimate interests and inalienable rights of the people of East Timor will be safeguarded in this process.
Rising from the ashes of a war that killed many millions, and caused mankind enormous material losses, which even today can still be felt, the United Nations has helped to avert new wars and major conflicts. The preservation of international peace and security is a vital need of mankind. This Organization is an instrument with the ability to guarantee satisfaction of that need, forming an appropriate forum in which to find solutions to the most complex problems of international relations today, in particular those related to colonization, development, peace and disarmament.
During the last 40 years, from 24 October 1945 to today, the United Nations has played an important role in the history of mankind, promoting the fundamental rights, self-determination and independence of peoples, as well as co-operation between developed and developing countries.
We would like to express our hope that the noble objectives for which the United Nations was created will be implemented on the basis of justice and the equality of Member States.
The struggle continues. Victory is certain."
AGO,2009,"First of all, 
allow me to take this important opportunity to 
congratulate Mr. Ali Treki on his election to preside 
over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I 
would like to assure him of the unconditional support 
of the Republic of Angola in fulfilling his important 
mission. The delegation of Angola is absolutely 
positive that under his auspicious leadership, the sixty-
fourth session will reaffirm the importance of the 
General Assembly in the search for consensual 
solutions to the burning issues affecting humanity, 
thereby greatly contributing to creating an increasingly 
safe, free and fair world. 
 I would also like to express my delegation’s deep 
appreciation to Mr. Treki’s predecessor, Mr. Miguel 
d’Escoto Brockmann, for the high degree of efficiency 
and vast expertise with which he conducted the work 
of the presidency. 
 Guided by the most elementary sense of justice, 
on behalf of the Republic of Angola, I express my 
deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban 
Ki-moon, for the excellence with which he has 
managed to consolidate reforms and ensure the 
fulfilment of the decisions of the Millennium Summit 
and other major United Nations conferences, as well as 
for the commitment that he has consistently shown in 
placing the needs and development of Africa at the 
centre of the international agenda. I would also like to 
praise the Secretary-General for his timely initiative to 
convene the high-level meeting on climate change. 
 The Assembly’s sixty-fourth session is taking 
place in a political, social and economic context of 
enormous complexity. Ensuring international peace and 
security, fighting poverty, protecting the environment, 
ensuring a better future for generations to come, 
ensuring the rule of law in relations among the 
members of the international community and 
promoting and safeguarding human rights — all of 
these issues are clearly among the major challenges 
confronting us. Combating organized crime and the 
implementation of the Anti-Terrorism Strategy are also 
factors of extreme importance that require the steady 
  
 
09-52604 32 
 
attention of the United Nations as it calls for more 
effective measures and a greater commitment from the 
international community. 
 These challenges must be added to the list of 
others to which our Organization must also devote 
great attention, especially the lack of decisions on 
disarmament, the persistence of armed conflicts and 
the consequences of these conflicts for the lives of 
people, and finally, the issue on the agenda for all 
Member States — the reform of the Security Council 
of the United Nations. 
 We live in a more globalized world, one that is 
increasingly characterized by substantial economic and 
social inequality. Hunger and poverty, aggravated by 
the fact that they are linked to endemic diseases such 
as malaria and tuberculosis, cause millions of deaths 
every year and in Africa are devastating an entire 
generation, dramatically jeopardizing the development 
and progress of our continent. It is therefore urgent that 
we reverse this situation, which is consuming our 
people, putting men and women at the mercy of 
inducements that inevitably lead to violence and crime 
and, to some extent, are the cause of some of the 
serious problems that humanity currently faces. 
 Food security thus seems to be one of the main 
concerns of the African continent, due to its importance 
to health, productivity, social and political stability and 
economic growth. Angola believes that it is possible to 
substantially reduce the food security deficit in Africa 
if the international community comes together around 
the following fundamental issues. 
 First, reserves of food and medicines for 
emergency aid and for people in need should be 
maintained. Secondly, national and regional integrated 
strategies and programmes in agriculture, trade, 
transport, water and vocational training — which can 
be implemented with the support and experience of the 
Food and Agriculture Organization, the International 
Fund for Agricultural Development and other United 
Nations specialized agencies — should be adopted. 
 Action plans within the framework of regional 
initiatives are also extremely important and can 
contribute to reducing food shortages and combating 
disease. Among other initiatives, I would like to 
highlight the New Partnership for Africa’s 
Development, the 2004 Ouagadougou Declaration and 
Plan of Action on employment and the eradication of 
extreme poverty, the Maputo Declaration proposing the 
allocation of 10 per cent of public expenditure to 
agriculture and rural development, the Sirte 
Declaration on agriculture and water, the Abuja 
Resolution on food safety, and the Abuja and Maputo 
Declarations on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and 
other related diseases. 
 The economic and financial crisis, though of 
exogenous origin, has also been seriously affecting the 
growth of African economies, due, among other 
reasons, to the reduction in asset values and financial 
assets held abroad, and mainly due to a marked 
decrease in the price of raw materials that are exported 
by countries on the continent. Rather than finding 
interim solutions in order to overcome immediate 
problems, the entire current economic and financial 
system should be reviewed. We need to identify ways 
of restructuring the world so that it serves the interests 
of all peoples and countries from a global perspective. 
 My Government welcomes the initiatives that, 
though insufficient, have been taken in the context of 
trade liberalization, and we support the idea of 
reforming the regulatory institutions of the financial 
and economic world. We also call for greater fluidity 
and transparency in the transfer of capital to less 
developed countries. 
 Similarly, Angola welcomes the various multilateral 
initiatives, emphasizing the Forum on China-Africa 
Cooperation, the Africa-South America Conference, the 
Tokyo International Conference on African Development, 
the Africa-Europe summit, the India-Africa Forum, the 
South Korea-Africa summit, and, more recently, the 
Turkey-Africa summit. The Angolan Government 
considers that all of these initiatives are of fundamental 
importance for the development of the least developed 
countries, which include most countries in Africa, and 
Angola in particular. 
 The Secretary-General presented an important 
report to the high-level meeting on Africa’s 
development needs (A/63/130), particularly on the 
implementation of commitments made by partners of 
the African continent, which took place on the margins 
of the Assembly’s sixty-third session. Angola shares 
the relevant concerns raised by the Secretary-General 
in that report, especially the references to the 
importance and urgency of moving from mere 
expressions of political will to concrete actions, with a 
comprehensive and vigorous pursuit of the goals 
envisaged. 
 
 
33 09-52604 
 
 The Secretary-General gave conclusive examples: 
a reduction of aid levels and commitments; 
cancellation of the foreign debt of African countries, 
which is taking a long time to materialize; and the 
negative effects arising from the failure to complete the 
World Trade Organization round of negotiations, which 
will result in fewer opportunities for the African 
continent. Angola shares all those concerns. As we 
conclude from all the eloquent statements by the 
speakers before me, there are no magic solutions or 
one-size-fits-all models to enable the least developed 
countries to find easy and immediate answers to 
development overnight. 
 As the President is certainly aware, economic 
growth in Angola has been quite encouraging. The 
invitation to my country to participate in the summit of 
the Group of Eight, held in L’Aquila, Italy, on 10 July — 
which greatly honoured the Angolan Government and 
people — was unquestionable proof of the international 
community’s recognition that Angola is on the right path 
towards promoting sustainable development. Between 
2004 and 2007, the national economy accumulated 
growth of 92.4 per cent in real terms. In barely four 
years, the value of the gross domestic product almost 
doubled, with an average annual real growth of 
approximately 17.8 per cent. In that same period, the 
country saw a sharp rise in the level of public and 
private investments, which generated a large number of 
jobs, in particular in the agricultural sector. 
 Angola is firmly committed to achieving 
universal education, as demonstrated by the fact that 
we have tripled the number of students in our 
education system. In 2005, as a result of the 
investments that the Government directed towards the 
social sector, Angola moved up five positions in the 
United Nations human development index ranking. 
And the country is committed to efforts towards 
achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals. In 
the area of sports, Angola recently won its tenth 
African basketball championship, and next January it 
will host the African Cup of Nations, having built the 
necessary infrastructure for that significant event for 
our continent. 
 Those major accomplishments, achieved in such a 
short time, fill all Angolans with pride and strengthen 
their confidence in the future. However, such 
achievements are possible only in peace and social 
harmony and when States themselves take on the 
primary responsibility for the development, progress 
and well-being of their populations. 
 Despite the progress already made in Africa in 
the areas of good governance and the 
institutionalization of the organs of the African Union, 
as well as in growth and economic and social 
development, we must be aware of the difficulties and 
the long way still to go. I am referring, for example, to 
the burning issue of promoting peace and security, 
essential conditions for the development and promotion 
of human rights. 
 In that regard, it is important to add that it is 
essential that the Security Council continue to fund 
operations for peace and security in Africa and to 
support the efforts of African States to combat drug 
trafficking, the illicit arms trade, piracy and terrorism. 
In addition, I believe it important to emphasize that the 
strategy of conflict prevention and resolution, in 
particular the mandates of peacekeeping missions, 
cannot be separate from measures to combat organized 
and transnational crime and the relationship between 
the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the 
illegal trade in small arms. Moreover, the conflict 
prevention and resolution strategy should be 
complemented by measures to combat the financing of 
terrorists, another major challenge facing the entire 
international community. 
 Speaking for a country that has chaired the 
United Nations Peacebuilding Commission, I am 
particularly pleased to note the progress in the peace 
processes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The 
inclusion of Guinea-Bissau on the agenda of the 
Peacebuilding Commission is also very important. In 
that regard, without false modesty I stress here the role 
played by Angola, not only in the negotiations that led 
to the holding of free and fair elections in that country, 
but also in consolidating peace and political, economic 
and social stability of that brother country. 
 The active participation of Angola in resolving 
the conflicts that have plagued several countries in 
various regions of Africa has clearly raised the 
expectations of the entire international community, in 
particular the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
and the Chairman of the African Union Commission. 
Allow me to reaffirm my Government’s commitment to 
continuing to work within the African Union and the 
  
 
09-52604 34 
 
United Nations in the search for lasting solutions for 
peacebuilding and national reconciliation. 
 It is fitting to refer here to another issue of utmost 
importance that is a consequence of armed conflict. 
That is the humanitarian situation — the maintenance 
and protection of refugee camps and identifying 
durable solutions for the millions of refugees whose 
rights must be protected and respected. 
 The United Nations is unquestionably the 
principal forum of multilateralism, and its credibility 
should constantly and increasingly be enhanced by the 
adoption of effective, creative and practical measures. 
Thus, the Government of Angola welcomes the new 
format and functions of the Economic and Social 
Council, especially the Annual Ministerial Review and 
the Development Cooperation Forum. Among the 
reforms that have already taken place, the 
establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and of 
the Human Rights Council should also be highlighted.  
 My country’s Government, despite welcoming the 
progress in the evolution and functioning of the United 
Nations system, cannot help note that the United 
Nations was created a long time ago — over half a 
century ago — at a particular time in the international 
community’s history that we all hope will never 
reoccur. 
 The world today is substantially different. The 
industrial, economic and social development of a large 
number of countries has narrowed the gap between the 
most developed countries and the least developed 
countries. Communications have advanced; technology 
has progressed; transport is much more sophisticated; 
and Internet surfing occurs throughout the world. 
Given this new reality, the Government of Angola 
believes that the structure of the Organization, which 
brings together people from around the world, cannot 
remain indifferent to those developments and should, 
therefore, adapt to the modern world. 
 Specifically, the Government of Angola considers 
that the fact that the reform of the Security Council, 
particularly aspects related to its composition and the 
democratization of its decision-making mechanism, has 
not evolved since 2005 suggests that this is a situation 
that must be corrected with urgency. 
 In that context, my Government hopes that the 
process of ongoing negotiations within the General 
Assembly will be conclusive. 
 Furthermore, the Government of Angola attaches 
great importance to the effort led by the United Nations 
to implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons, and disarmament in general, and 
recognizes that it deserves the utmost attention of all 
its Members. 
 Angola also believes that the United Nations 
should strengthen its monitoring of the implementation 
of its Programme of Action on Small Arms and develop 
initiatives to promote the universalization of the 
Ottawa Convention on Landmines. 
 At the end of my statement, I would like to avail 
myself of this golden opportunity to launch an appeal 
for the lifting of the economic, trade and financial 
embargo on Cuba. It is fair and imperative to abolish 
that embargo, because it violates the principles of 
international law, in particular Articles 1 and 2 of the 
United Nations Charter. 
 Angola is fully convinced that the United Nations 
will not refrain from once again taking a clear and fair 
position on that embargo, a position that is also 
consistent with the principles of the Charter. 
 Finally, I would like to reiterate my conviction 
that with effort and determination, our Organization 
will be in a position to correct asymmetries and 
provide solutions to problems that still exist in the 
international community in order to build a world that 
is more fair, stable, and secure and able to provide 
current and future generations with a standard of living 
consistent with human dignity."
AGO,2000,"Allow me to begin by
congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government
and on my own behalf, on your assumption of the
presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General
Assembly.
I also wish to congratulate, in particular, the
outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the wise
and dynamic manner in which he carried out his
mandate. I would also like to express our appreciation
to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfish
efforts to make the United Nations an increasingly
effective instrument, capable of dealing with the
demands of our times and finding and implementing
solutions for the most pressing problems of the world.
Just a few days ago, during the Millennium
Summit, the leaders of the world defined the priorities
of the United Nations for the twenty-first century and
expressed the need to adapt its structure for the
demands and challenges of the future. During that
event of transcendental importance for the lives of the
people of this planet, the indispensable and
irreplaceable character of the United Nations in
international relations was reaffirmed. Member States
reiterated their promise to maintain and preserve the
United Nations as a privileged mechanism for
international dialogue and cooperation in the name of
peace and well-being of all peoples.
Indeed, given the role of the United Nations as
guarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples, it is
urgent that we begin the implementation of actions
aimed at adapting its internal structure to new world
realities. This will permit the Organization to deal
rapidly and effectively with the main problems of the
world and avoid having its members resort to solutions
outside the established framework of its main
organs  namely, the General Assembly and the
Security Council.
In recent years, the United Nations sought,
through world summits, to find global solutions with
broad international consensus for the many misfortunes
that afflict humanity, such as local wars, degradation of
the environment, violations of human rights and
inadequate social development, among others. Various
plans of action were outlined. However, the problems
12

they sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many have
even become worse.
A revision of the mechanism for implementing
decisions is needed, through a revitalization and
strengthening of the United Nations system,
particularly that of its principal bodies, such as the
Security Council. From our point of view, that body
requires greater internal democracy, and its
composition should reflect the current membership in
the Organization and its geographic diversity. We think
that, in this way, its decision-making would be faster
and its performance in the area of peacekeeping and
international security more effective.
The persistence of a climate of insecurity and
instability in a number of regions of the world cannot
be attributed solely to internal causes; it also stems
from weakness in the international security system. A
reflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist, for
example, in the early warning system and in the
peacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have not
always corresponded to the desired objectives, either
because the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not
sent in a timely manner, or because at times, they are
not provided with adequate human, material and
financial resources. Sometimes this is due to the
ambiguity in the mission mandate itself.
We recognize that the effectiveness of action in
the area of peace and international security does not
depend only on United Nations activities. There has to
be renewed commitment on the part of each and every
State. On this matter, I would like to applaud the recent
publication of the Brahimi report.
It is our understanding that the adoption of
measures at the national, regional and international
levels should be made part of this commitment in order
to eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. In
the particular case of the African continent, the
continent most affected by the scourge of war, the
illicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source of
support for wars incited by some rebel groups with the
objective of overturning democratically elected
regimes. Some new initiatives have been launched with
the aim of reducing access of these conflict
diamonds to the international market. My Government
supports these initiatives and will provide any
cooperation necessary for their implementation.
Another serious issue affecting international
security is the circulation and transfer of small arms
that flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups.
This takes place with the connivance of certain
Governments and networks of transnational organized
crime. The lack of international legal instruments
capable of controlling transactions of these arms is
stimulating the creation of actual arms markets, above
all in Africa. This is leading to an increased number of
conflicts and making their resolution even more
difficult. According to United Nations data, the effects
of these arms on civil populations are shocking. They
have already resulted in more deaths than the two
world wars combined. In fact, the issue of conflict
diamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumes
special importance for Angola. It is through the sale of
illegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi reconstituted their war machine, with which
they then undertook a large-scale military campaign
aimed at taking power. That war campaign led to a
procession of death and destruction, and it is the
principal reason for the economic instability in Angola.
This scenario is repeating itself in other regions of
Africa and the world. For this reason, a solution is
urgently required.
The economic and social development and
subsequent eradication of poverty, full respect for
human rights, democracy and good governance can
only be achieved in absolute conditions of peace and
stability. It is in this context that my Government
established, as a priority, the restoration of definitive
peace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain this
objective, the general situation in Angola has
significantly improved. It is for this reason that today
we are more confident than ever of a future of peace,
development and prosperity.
Indeed, the war has ceased to have the same
intensity as it did several years ago, and the conflict
itself is moving progressively towards an end. The
political and military measures undertaken by the
Government have significantly reduced the ability of
the rebels to wage war. These measures have also
allowed the Government to resume control over nearly
the entire country.
More than 12,000 rebel military personnel have
abandoned their arms and joined the efforts of
reconstruction and national reconciliation. Those who
persist in waging war have less and less space, and
their activities are limited today to isolated armed
attacks against civilian targets, the objective being to
destroy and loot the people's property.
13

The military measures undertaken by the
Government represent a necessary and legitimate
recourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by the
rebels of UNITA, which put in jeopardy the very
existence of the Angolan democratic system. However,
despite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at the
total control of our national borders and the elimination
of the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups are
having a positive impact in the search for peace, they
do not constitute our only option for the resolution of
armed conflict.
Simultaneously, we will continue to implement
other actions aimed at guaranteeing the total
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which for us
continues to be a valid basis for the resolution of the
Angolan problem. In this context, we reiterate our
readiness to continue to integrate in our society all
those who choose to abandon the option of war.
The international community, and the United
Nations in particular, still has an active role to play in
the process of restoring peace in Angola, through the
continued implementation and strengthening of
sanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
The recent nomination by the Secretary-General
of the members of the mechanism to monitor the
application of sanctions against the UNITA rebels, in
accordance with Security Council resolution 1295
(2000), will contribute to greater international
vigilance regarding possible violations. It will deny
bases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. We
hope that all Members of the United Nations will
extend their cooperation to that body.
The significant improvement of the situation in
Angola, however, has not brought an immediate end to
the effects of war on the lives of the people. The
humanitarian situation continues to be critical, and for
that reason we appeal to the international community to
increase its assistance to the needy populations.
The positive evolution of the situation is not
limited to the politico-military field; it has also carried
over into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continues
on the path of economic reforms which have earned the
confidence of international financial institutions. This
progress translated to the recent signature of an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund
relating to the implementation of a monitored
programme.
We hope that the international community will
contribute substantially through the investment of
capital during the recovery phase of the Angolan
economy in supporting stability and growth. Angola
adopted legislation to protect foreign investment by
providing incentives and guarantees.
The international situation continues to be
characterized by violence and tension in various parts
of the world; they constitute a serious threat to peace
and stability. Angola is seriously concerned by the
continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo in view of the grave repercussions for
stability and development in the central region of
Africa. The situation in that neighbouring country,
which shares more than 2,000 kilometres of common
border with Angola, remains quite volatile and
complex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening if
appropriate measures are not taken.
The resolution of the Congolese conflict must
come about, fundamentally, through the
implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In
spite of its shortcomings, which perhaps call for a new
reading, it continues to be the only basis acceptable to
all the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. Invading forces should withdraw completely
from Congolese territory and cease immediately their
support for the destabilization of that country.
These conditions, in addition to the inter-
Congolese dialogue, founded on a realistic base
including the unequivocal recognition of the authority
of the Government in Kinshasa, will be crucial for the
success of the peace process. Angola reiterates its
commitment to continue to make the necessary efforts,
together with the mediator, President Frederick Chiluba
of Zambia, and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement,
until a way out of the conflict is found.
In Sierra Leone, the prosecution of hostilities
continues to delay the pacification of the country.
Angola supports regional initiatives aimed at
reactivating the peace process and condemns the
attacks against United Nations personnel and forces.
We support steps aimed at bringing to international
justice the principal parties responsible for the
atrocities committed against the people of that country.
In Somalia, the progress reached at the national
conference led to the re-establishment of some national
institutions and moved the country closer to peace.
14

Angola encourages the continuation of these efforts
and hopes that in the near future Somalia may be able
to reassume, de facto, its rightful place in the
international community.
In the Horn of Africa, the conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positive
movement following the signing of the Cessation of
Hostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the two
parties honour their commitments under the accord and
create conditions for the establishment of good-
neighbourly relations and cooperation.
Similarly, we continue to be optimistic regarding
the resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara through
the implementation of the United Nations peace plan.
Angola is following with particular attention the
situation in Zimbabwe, our fraternal country, and
supports the efforts of the Government of that country
to find a just and fair solution to the land problem that
was inherited from the colonial period. In this context,
we share and fully support the position expressed by
the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on land
reform in Zimbabwe.
In the Middle East, the question of Palestine
constitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in the
region. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of the
Palestinian people to self-determination. The resolution
of this conflict must encompass a political compromise
between the parties involved and the effective
implementation of relevant Security Council
resolutions and other understandings reached.
Less than a year ago, the people of East Timor
finally succeeded in exercising their right to self-
determination. Angola feels pleased and compensated
by this historic accomplishment, since it was one of the
countries that fought in the United Nations and other
international forums for the right of the Timorese
people to freely choose their own destiny.
The international community, and the United
Nations in particular, which is responsible for the
management of the transition period, cannot permit the
current climate of violence, provoked by the militias
with the objective of impeding the independence of the
territory, to impose itself over the will of a people that
has already suffered for decades the scourge of
colonialism and foreign domination. Angola strongly
condemns these acts of violence, which have resulted
in great loss of life, destruction and chaos. Angola
appeals to the Security Council to take appropriate
steps to ensure its immediate cessation.
In the past two years, the world economy has
registered a clear recovery since the crisis that shook
Asia. The industrial economies and the so-called
emerging markets are becoming stronger and achieving
considerable rates of growth. However, the present
world economic order continues to be marked by sharp
distortions between North and South. While the North
enjoys unprecedented prosperity, the South continues
to suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing to
these ills are restrictive economic measures imposed
unilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is one
example  its principal victims are the most
vulnerable strata of its population. We will continue to
support the lifting of the embargo.
The international goal of reducing by one half, by
the year 2015, the percentage of the world population
living in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts,
above all by the wealthiest countries and international
financial institutions. In particular, it will be necessary
to relieve the burden of external debt, whose service
payments alone absorb a large part of the financial
resources of developing countries.
At the same time, steps will be necessary to
attenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despite
the fact that it has strengthened the spirit of community
in international economic relations, globalization has
benefited wealthy countries more than underdeveloped
countries. The structural adjustment programmes under
way in many developing countries should take account
of real necessities and specifics, because many of the
measures imposed by the international financial
institutions have caused serious difficulties, above all
of a social nature.
To conclude my remarks, I would like to call
attention to the need to pay more attention to the
economic situation of the African continent. This
should be done in such a way as to facilitate its
integration into the world market, particularly through
the transfer of technology and increasing productive
investment.












"
AGO,1986,"At the outset allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous election to the presidency of the Assembly at this session, during which, we are confident, we shall be able to achieve the goals we shall propose in this important forum.
Allow me also to avail myself of this opportunity to express our admiration of your predecessor, Mr. Jaime de Pinies, whose insight and judiciousness greatly helped us to surmount e. number of obstacles and made his mission successful.
We should also like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his efforts to find solutions to the many problems facing mankind. Mr. de Cuellar has shown great concern for the preservation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations notwithstanding the limited resources available and the adverse influence of certain Western Powers that are more interested in their own strategic interests than in joining forces to achieve international peace and security.
Every year in this same place the representatives of all the nations make a pledge of peace, disarmament, freedom and development, reflecting the determination of the great majority of nations to achieve those goals and thus strive for the survival of the human race.
Even given the strong will of the peace-loving countries, a paradoxical reality subsists: the world has never been as exposed as it is today to the threat of a nuclear war that could destroy its entire population.
In spite of united Nations General Assembly resolution 3093 (XXVIII), which prescribes a 10 per cent cut in the military budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council for the benefit of the developing countries, the arms race has not been halted, and it has now reached outer space. While certain countries spend huge amounts of money on their military programs, the majority of the developing countries face a critical economic situation that prevents them from achieving
social and economicdevelopment programs.
We feel that the international community should not remain passive. In the face of this situation, we call for intensified efforts on the part of all peace and freedom-loving countries to reverse the negative trend. Similarly, Angola welcomes the USSR's initiative unilaterally to extend the moratorium on nuclear testing and its recent proposal on the gradual banning and elimination of nuclear arms by the year 2000 and the creation of an international global security system. We also support unconditionally the proposal presented in May this year by the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations Secretary-General regarding the creation of an international organization for the peaceful use of outer space, and we urge all Member States of our Organization to join in this initiative, which undoubtedly would bring benefits to all countries, regardless of
their stage of development.
Angola is a sovereign independent country situated in Africa, in the southern
part of the continent. Since its independence 11 years ago, our country has actively followed a policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. Our Constitution is very clear about our country's willingness to maintain diplomatic relations with all the countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries and of non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States in accordance with the norms of international law governing relations between independent States.
Unfortunately it is in that subregion of the his lean continent that is found the abhorrent and obsolete apartheid system condemned by the vast majority of countries. That system continues to be a destabilizing factor for the countries of the region, particularly South Africa's neighboring countries, which are the victims of repeated violent aggression resulting from its arrogance and disregard of the resolutions of the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of African unity.
In spite of its strong traditional inclination for peace, our people has not known a moment of peace since the very beginning of its independence, and our country is the victim of continuous armed aggression launched by South Africa from the illegally occupied Territory of Namibia.
The People's Republic of Angola continues to be faced with an undeclared war situation created by the South African racist regime, .which has forced the Angolan people to endure enormous sacrifices as a result of the train put on our country's financial, material and human resources, which seriously affected our economic and social development.
defenseless children, women and elderly people are among South Africa's favorite targets and the racist forces constantly blow up our bridges, railways and roads and destroy our hospitals and schools, not sparing our industrial installations.
Material damage caused to our country has been estimated at $12 billion. This figure does not include the money spent in youth mobilization and youth defense programs. The South African regular army, with the collaboration of South African trained UNITA puppet groups, has perpetrated numerous atrocities and is responsible for a large number of deaths.
The Angolan people, who, under the Portuguese colonial rule during^ the 14 years of its struggle for national liberation to regain its freedom and dignity, usurped for five centuries by Portuguese colonialism, had already borne many sacrifices and lost many of its best countrymen, has longed for peace for its newly independent country, so that it could build a strong nation through its natural resources and make use of the country's huge potential for the Angolan people.
The imperialist world has always tried to show the current situation in our country as a civil war, while in fact it is rather a foreign invasion of a United Nations Member State, whose territory was partly occupied by the racist SouthAfrican armed forces. That is why Angola continues to insist on the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the South African forces from its territory.
Racist South Africa uses the Namibian territory as a springboard for its attacks on Angola. The South African military bases in northern Namibia train the rebel and mercenary groups that infiltrate our territory. It is from those bases that the South African troops make incursions into our country and provide military support to the armed groups which operate in Angola under South African command.
South Africa's acts of aggression against Angola, encouraged by successive United States administrations, started soon after our country's independence. In 1975, the apartheid regime invaded our territory and occupied the south.
In the light of these facts and in conformity with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, the People's Republic of Angola requested help from friendly countries. The presence of Cuban troops in Angola has nothing to do with the independence of Namibia and consequently should not be seen as a threat to South Africa, which does not share any border with the People's Republic of Angola.
Conscious of the complexity of the international situation and desirous of seeing the impasse created by racist South Africa and the Reagan Administration resolved through United Nations implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), the Government of the People's Republic of Angola presented, in a letter from President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, a negotiation package proposal, dated 17 November 1984.
The racist Pretoria regime responded to the well intentioned Angolan initiative with further violent attacks on the People's Republic of Angola. Their most recent acts of aggression were the attacks on the village of Xangongo and the commercial port of Namibe, with a significant number of Angolan casualties and heavy material damage.
In the last weeks, we have seen the concentration of over 10 South African army battalions along our southern border, a sufficient signal for us to anticipate a new major offensive against our country.
By trying to make implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) depend on the removal of the Cuban troops from Angola, the South African Government, along with the Reagan Administration, resorts to an excuse an old misleading pretext in order to impede Namibia's independence and transform that illegally occupied Territory into a springboard to keep destabilizing Angola with sustained acts of aggression.
We could not comment on the world economic crisis without mentioning the problems that are at its origin. Notwithstanding the efforts already made by the United Nations, certain developed countries still adopt policies that will not do much to help improve economic relations between developed and developing countries.
In fact, as far as monetary and financial matters are concerned, the problem lies with the inadequacy of structures that no longer meet the exigencies of the world's economic recovery as a result of the selfish policies pursued by certain developed countries, which consequently worsen the balance of payments and the external debt of the developing countries. It is therefore important that, without delay, we concentrate on the task of restructuring the current monetary and financial system in order to enable the developing countries to share in decision-making and take advantage of eventual benefits.
It is important to reflect on how far the negative changes of the world's monetary and financial system have exacerbated the external debt crisis of the underdeveloped countries, forcing them into default. Such changes have frustrated the development prospects of those countries, bringing about critical political and social repercussions.
While in the first: quarter of 1984 the combined foreign debt of the developing countries already reached $600 billion, today that debt is estimated at more than $900 billion, which is a discouraging factor that frustrates all optimistic hopes for development as long as the developing countries are compelled to spend larger debt repayments amounts than their revenues allow.
The International Monetary Fund is far from having achieved the objectives set forth in its by-laws and we feel, therefore, that there is a need in the monetary and financial areas for the creation of a mechanism for South-South co-operation at the regional level to alleviate and ultimately eliminate financial dependence on that institution.
One of the causes of the present world economic crisis is, no doubt, the recurrent violation by the developed countries of international trade principles, rules and regulations. The proliferation of discriminatory measures imposed by the developed countries in their trade with their developing counterparts, a growing protectionist attitude and other restrictive measures are responsible for the decrease in the revenue from the exports of the developing countries, which limit their opportunities to invest in other areas more beneficial to their development.
In this context, we wish to reiterate the need for all the underdeveloped countries to ratify the Integrated Program for Commodities contained in resolution 93 (IV) of the Fourth United Conference on Trade and Development, and ensure the entry into operation of the Common Fund as soon as possible.
The lack of human, material, financial and technological resources in some of the underdeveloped countries should provide a reason for strengthening and improving the co-operation between those countries, and it should provide strong motivation for contributing to the collective and individual autonomy of our countries and strengthening their power to negotiate with the developed countries.
In southern Africa, despite the aggressive acts of the racist regime of South Africa, co-operation within the framework of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference has made significant progress in several areas, as demonstrated by the adoption of a number of conclusions and resolutions adopted at the recent submit conference of Baads of State or Government held in Luanda from
18 to 22 August 1986.
We realize, however, that much remains to be done on the African continent,
where we have to live and to survive despite our major problems. The United Nations General Assembly's special session on Africa in May 1986, where a program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development was adopted, constituted a positive step towards the adoption by the international community of measures to support the African countries in their struggle to emerge from the difficult situation in which they find themselves.
I have decided not to read out the entire text of try speech, but it will be distributed. However, I should like to take advantage of the last few minutes scheduled for my speech to comment briefly on what has already been said, especially the statement made about my country by the United states of America.
I have already presented the views of my country on the international situation with respect to southern Africa. Angola is a peace-loving country whose people liberated themselves in 1975 through their own arduous efforts and the militant solidarity of friendly countries, and other Members of our Organization, of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, and of the OAU, in accordance with their principles and the rules of international law. Angola will continue its solidarity with and its unselfish aid to those people still fighting against colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism. Its external policy is based on the principles of justice, equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States.
I should like to take this opportunity to recall that Angola, as an independent and sovereign State, cannot accept the use of false and distorted representations of the real situation that exists in my country to justify attempts at interference and make false accusations against us of secret motives that my country has always rejected and fought against. My Government does not accept that type of policy, and I must reaffirm that in Angola, it is the Angolans themselves -and only they - who decide their own destiny.
The frequent declaration by the United States that Angola is governed by an
anti-people and repressive regime is simply a blatant falsehood and an act of
interference in the internal affairs of the Angolan Government. The truth of the
matter is that facts themselves give the lie to such statements and demonstrate the
true situation. The truth is that for over 10 years, Angola has suffered acts of
aggression committed by the racist regime of South Africa, as a result of the help
that regime has received from its allies - above all, the Government of the United States of America.
The presence of Cuban forces in our country is in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, and the result of an invitation by our Government. Cuban Internationalist forces are helping our people to defend themselves from external pressure exerted by the racist regime of South Africa, and for that reason will remain on our soil until our Government decides to the contrary.
I would like to recall the words of Comrade President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, in his speech in Cape Verde on 22 December, when he said that the tension in southern Africa is tending towards a progressive aggravation because some of the Western Powers, instead of associating themselves with the efforts of the international community to allow Namibia to accede to independence on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and to eliminate the apartheid system, which undoubtedly is solely responsible for the climate of destabilization, insecurity and conflict prevailing in that subregion, are seeking to protect their financial and economic interests, allying themselves with the white racist minority regime of South Africa.
"
AGO,2006,"On behalf of 
my Government, I wish to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa 
on her election to the presidency of the General 
Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident 
that under her guidance and leadership, this session 
will be productive and will attain the goals set. I assure 
her of my delegation’s full cooperation. 
 I would also like to take this opportunity to 
express my country’s appreciation to the Secretary-
General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the valuable work he has 
performed during the 10 years of his mandate, which is 
now drawing to a close. 
 Mr. Annan has made an indelible mark on the 
history of the United Nations by paying special 
attention to the most pertinent problems affecting our 
planet, especially the African continent. In particular, 
Angola praises the role which Mr. Annan has played 
during the most critical phase of the Organization’s 
history. I trust that the next Secretary-General will find 
in Mr. Kofi Annan’s legacy an impressive reference for 
the reinforcement of the Organization’s capacity to 
deal with the principal problems facing humanity. 
 The aspirations to stability, security and social 
justice of the peoples represented in this Assembly 
continue to be unfulfilled. The persisting armed 
violence in some States and the meagre results in the 
fight against world poverty have been contributing to 
this picture; consequently, these make up the chief 
challenges facing the United Nations. 
 With regard to the new tendencies towards 
violence, we see something new. It is more 
indiscriminate; it emerges not only from inter-State or 
internal conflicts, but rather, and increasingly, it arises 
from actions that seek to alter the way of life of 
societies through intimidation and the brutal 
destruction of human lives. 
 In recent times alone, over a dozen countries in 
four continents have been severely affected by acts of 
terror, which have become the most direct and 
immediate threat to international peace and security. In 
spite of political or ideological differences, the 
international community has, in general terms, 
demonstrated firmness and unity in the fight against 
acts of terror. We are of the view that this form of 
collective action must continue to be the most 
appropriate way of dealing with threats to international 
security, including terrorism. 
 Poverty indexes around the world are also a 
contributing factor to the bleak present-day 
international situation. Half of the world’s population, 
or three billion people, continue to live on less than 
two dollars a day; 640 million people are without 
appropriate housing; 400 million people do not have 
access to drinking water; and 270 million people lack 
medical assistance. Close to one billion people have 
entered the twenty-first century illiterate and with little 
hope of emerging from spiritual and material poverty. 
 Africa is the continent most affected by this 
scourge, and not even the potential for economic 
growth of some of our countries permits us to hope that 
the poverty indexes will be drastically reduced. 
 Notwithstanding this unwelcome picture, in 
recent times, we have seen significant progress in the 
area of peace and security, democracy and respect for 
human rights. For instance, the resolution through 
dialogue of the Angolan internal conflict, which was 
among the longest-running conflicts in Africa, 
constitutes one of the more significant success stories 
in this regard. Recently, the Angolan Government 
opted for the same path of dialogue and negotiation in 
order to extend the peace process to the territory of 
Cabinda, where some insecurity persisted. 
 The establishment of peace in Angola was the 
supreme objective of a sensible and principled political 
process led by President José Eduardo dos Santos, 
whose goals were: to liberate, together with some 
forces in our region, the people of southern Africa from 
the dominance of oppressor regimes; to settle the 
conflicts in Central Africa through negotiation; to 
extinguish the threat that some States represented to 
their neighbours; and, finally, to economically develop 
and integrate the region. 
 The fruits of this political endeavour are visible 
today: the people of the region, who before were under 
oppressive regimes, now live in freedom and have built 
democratic societies. With Angola’s support, one State 
in Central Africa settled its internal conflict, and, once 
  
 
06-53005 50 
 
free, its people took charge of their destiny and 
recovered their sense of peace and stability. Another 
State in Central Africa overthrew the dictatorship that 
had oppressed its people and had created a permanent 
focus of regional tension by acting as a source of 
instability for neighbouring countries. Today, the 
people of that country are engaged in building a new 
democratic society by means of transparent elections 
and national reconciliation. 
 Now that peace has been achieved, one of the 
fundamental objectives of the Government of Angola is 
the complete elimination of factors of conflict. We 
have prioritized the pursuit of political reforms with a 
view to the consolidation of a democratic regime and a 
righteous State, aware that these constitute 
prerequisites for the maintenance of peace, political 
stability, respect for citizens’ rights and economic 
development. This is a serious commitment which my 
Government will not forsake, the main objective being 
the regular holding of elections. 
 The next electoral process is at an advanced stage 
of preparation, and voter registration will begin next 
November. My Government is creating all the 
necessary conditions to make the next elections 
transparent and credible, so that their results are 
accepted by all the parties, and so that they constitute a 
step on the road to prosperity. Therefore, the 
organization of the next elections is going ahead surely 
and firmly. 
 Other priorities are the reintegration of the 
displaced population, refugees and former combatants, 
as well as the rehabilitation of the economy and the 
reduction of poverty. These areas have registered 
important progress. In only four years of peace, 
roughly 4.5 million displaced persons and more than 
400,000 refugees have been resettled. Nearly 200,000 
former combatants and members of their families have 
been socially and productively reintegrated; and 
countless infrastructures that were destroyed by the 
conflict are also being rehabilitated. 
 The national economy is characterized by a solid 
macroeconomic stability resulting from a coherent 
monetary and budgetary policy. It is among the fastest-
growing economies in the world. For 2006 and future 
years, we foresee continuous, vigorous economic 
growth, of the order of 20 per cent. 
 In social terms, the results over the last four years 
are also encouraging. Poverty has been reduced from 
over 80 per cent to 56 per cent. With the ongoing 
implementation of poverty reduction programmes and 
substantial investment in capital goods, we foresee a 
gradual improvement of social well-being and 
employment indexes in the short term. The global 
advances which my country has achieved in four years 
of peace are evidence that its people can look to the 
new Angola with real hope. The international 
community can count on Angola as a dependable 
partner. 
 In the area of peace, important progress has been 
made in other parts of the African continent. The 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, a neighbour and 
brother of Angola, is steadily approaching a situation 
of normality, which is likely to contribute to the 
lessening of tensions in Central Africa and in the Great 
Lakes region. Recently, and for the first time in its 
history, the people of this country exercised their right 
to freely choose their legitimate representatives. Such 
an act marks a crucial stage in the process of 
democratic transition and the consolidation of internal 
stability. It was made possible by the support of the 
international community, particularly of Angola, which 
supplied $30 million and some logistical means for the 
electoral process. 
 Angola has always stood by the Congolese people 
and always will. It contributed to the cessation of the 
internal conflict that devastated the country and is 
currently contributing to building the capacity of the 
Congolese institutions charged with maintaining 
internal peace, security and order. It is now up to the 
Congolese parties to demonstrate that they are truly 
committed to peace and democracy. We want to believe 
that they will not frustrate the expectations of their 
people and of the international community and that 
they will respect the verdict of the ballot box. 
 The situation in Côte d’Ivoire remains volatile. 
The Ivorian people continue to be the principal victims 
of a conflict that is jeopardizing the country’s future. 
Angola associates itself with the efforts of the 
international community to reach a definitive and 
peaceful resolution of the conflict in that country. 
 In the Middle East, the continuing violence is 
rendering ineffective any blueprints for peace aimed at 
resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. 
Angola supports the right to existence of all States in 
the area as well as their right to live in peace with their 
neighbours. It is important to return to a process aimed 
 
 
51 06-53005 
 
at the peaceful resolution of the conflict — a process 
based on the road map for peace — in order to arrive at 
a comprehensive solution leading to regional 
stabilization. 
 Angola hopes that the people of Iraq and of 
Afghanistan will be able, in the short term, to fulfil 
their aspirations to live free from violence and from 
tension, and that those countries will be respected as 
sovereign and genuine States. 
 In conclusion, we would like to reiterate our 
desire that the process of reform of the United Nations, 
mainly of the Security Council, be accelerated. The 
current composition of that organ is anachronistic and 
fails to reflect the contemporary structures of the 
international community. 
 In the context of United Nations reform, we wish 
to stress the importance of the recent creation of the 
Peacebuilding Commission and of the Human Rights 
Council. I would like in that respect to express my 
gratitude to all Members of the United Nations for the 
trust they placed in my country, which is to preside 
over the Peacebuilding Commission during its first 
years of existence. "
AGO,1982,"It is a great pleasure to begin by extending to the President on 
behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola, our most 
heartfelt congratulations on his election at this thirty-seventh 
session of the general  Assembly. Allow me to avail myself of this 
opportunity to express our great satisfaction at seeing preside over 
this august Assembly, a distinguished representative of a socialist 
country, the People's Republic of Hungary, with which we maintain 
excellent relations of friendship, solidarity and co-operation. We 
wish him every success in the exercise of his lofty responsibilities. 
May I also reaffirm to Mr. Kittani, our deep appreciation for the 
dignified and clear-sighted manner in which he acquitted himself of 
his mandate during the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly. May I 
further reiterate to the Secretary-General our most sincere 
appreciation for his tireless efforts in seeking the most appropriate 
solutions to the grave problems which the international community 
faces.
184.	The thirty-seventh session is being held at a very critical 
time, since the international situation has deteriorated seriously to 
the point of gravely threatening the survival of a certain number of 
peoples.

185.	Every year we all come to participate in the annual session 
of the general Assembly; a torrent of speeches is heard, support for 
the noble principles of freedom, peace, justice, democracy, 
solidarity, development and co-operation is reaffirmed by every one 
of us, but, unfortunately, the application of these ideas stops for 
some among us as soon as we leave the United Nations Headquarters.

186.	Repeatedly, and from this very rostrum, we have expressed our 
profound concern because of the progressive deterioration in the 
international situation and because of its disastrous consequences 
for all of mankind. We cannot, nor should we conceal our great 
anguish at seeing the impotence, the resignation or the abdication of 
the competent international bodies when faced with the proliferation 
of hotbeds of tension, which are deliberately and dangerously kindled 
by imperialist Powers, and in particular by the present United States 
Administration.

187.	No one here should ignore the causes and agents which are 
responsible for so sombre a picture. We wonder how long peoples and 
Governments which love peace and justice will have to wait for the 
adequate existing United Nations organs firmly to shoulder their 
responsibilities and take really effective measures -which are 
available to them-with respect to the Governments of certain Western 
Powers, in order to put an end to: the flagrant violations of the 
fundamental principles of the Charter; continuance of colonial wars, 
and the promoting of aggressions of every kind, directly or 
indirectly against States which adopt independent and progressive 
positions; the economic plundering of underdeveloped countries and 
the persistent prevention of a gradual reduction in the ever-widening 
gap between the rich developed countries, and the poor underdeveloped 
countries; the imposition of military bases in every comer of the 
world, generally maintained against the will of the peoples; the 
insistence on hampering the serious efforts made by the socialist 
countries and progressive and democratic forces to achieve detente, 
general  and complete disarmament, the global prohibition of the 
manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, in particular 
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, including the neutron bomb; 
the accelerated rise of military budgets and expenditures stimulated 
by an escalation in the arms race, so that these astronomical amounts 
of money might be judiciously devoted to the economic and social 
development of the underdeveloped countries; and the systematic 
manoeuvres designed to counter the establishment of a new 
international economic order, as advocated by the movement of 
non-aligned countries.

188.	Faced with this alarming situation, which obviously endangers 
the future of peoples, and faced with the growing tragedy endured by 
millions of human beings, who are still deprived of their freedom and 
the right to choose their own destiny, lacking in the ways and means 
to fight against servitude, humiliation, tyranny, wretchedness, 
famine, ignorance and disease, we feel compelled to repeat, who bears 
the grave responsibility, in the first place, for such a 
deterioration in the international situation? As we see it, it is the 
present United States Administration, and certain of its allies and 
agents, or preferred instruments which, bear this responsibility: the 
racist and Fascist regimes of Pretoria and Tel Aviv.

189.	We see it this way because of the firm conviction of the 
Government of the People's Republic of Angola that no country that 
was socialist, progressive or loved peace and justice has taken or 
will take initiatives to promote hotbeds of tension, to unleash a 
nuclear war or use other weapons of mass destruction, because the 
survival of mankind, international peace and security, the 
independence of peoples and peaceful coexistence are for them a 
primary principle and objective.

190.	World problems which seriously affect peace, security, 
development, freedom and independence require considerable efforts 
from the international community as a whole and a global response 
that has due regard forth fact that each people has the right freely 
to choose its own political, economic, social and cultural system, 
without intimidation or pressures; that it is the right of every 
people to be in charge of its own national riches and to exploit them 
for its own benefit; that it is the right of every people to reject 
any form of subordination to and dependence on any source, and any 
interference or pressure, political, economic or military.

191.	There is no denying that in the present situation detente, 
general and complete disarmament, the nuclear threat and the arms 
race are the major concerns of countries that love peace and justice. 
In this respect, may we recall that the position of Angola has been 
clearly defined once again during the second special session of the 
General Assembly devoted to disarmament, so we need not repeat it 
here.

192.	Since the People's Republic of Angola is a geopolitical 
component of the African continent, it is legitimate for the 
Government of Angola to give primary attention to African problems, 
in particular to those of southern Africa, in view of the grave 
implications for the region and for the world.

193.	For some 20 years many relevant resolutions have been adopted 
by the United Nations, the OAU and the non-aligned movement, 
recognizing, on the one hand, the right of the Namibian people to 
self-determination and independence and, on the other hand, 
denouncing or firmly condemning the illegal occupation of Namibia by 
the criminal South African regime.

194.	Directly confronted with threats, aggression and armed 
invasion by the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime since 1975, the 
People's Republic of Angola expects from the international community 
a decisive commitment in line with the requirements of our time,, so 
that the problem of Namibia may be finally settled and so that the 
people of Angola may, for its part, be able to expel the racist 
invaders, to respond to future aggression and to ensure the defence 
of its national Sovereignty and territorial integrity.

195.	What is the situation today? As we nil know, the contact 
group submitted to SWAPO, the frontline States and to Nigeria in 
October 1981 a plan of action that includes three phases; first, the 
adoption

by the end of January of 1982 of the so-called constitutional 
principles by the concerned and interested parties, principles which 
are to be included in the future, constitution, of Namibia; secondly, 
approval by the end of March by the Security Council of the 
composition and size of the United Nations troop contingent, and 
resolution of the question of the United. Nations  impartiality 
raised by the Pretoria regime; thirdly, implementation, starting in 
April, of the United Nations plan in accordance with Security Council 
resolution 435 (1978), containing four fundamental aspects: a 
cease-fire; the gradual reduction of South African troops to 1,500 
men; stationing of United Nations troops in Namibia; and free and 
fair elections.

196.	Since the first meetings with the contact group -and quite 
outside its framework and mission-the United States delegation has 
asked for bilateral contacts with the Angolan authorities and has 
begun to try to link the presence of the Cuban internationalist 
forces in the People's Republic of Angola to the negotiating process 
for the independence of Namibia. This has always been firmly rejected 
by the Government of Angola, in view of the absurdity of such a 
linkage which, in fact, ill conceals the obsession or paranoia of the 
United States Administration about the stationing of the Cuban 
internationalist forces in the People's Republic of Angola.

197.	In view of the deadlock in the negotiations on the first 
phase, because of the electoral system proposed by the contact group, 
and since the presence of Cuban forces in the People's Republic of 
Angola has become the subject of a slanderous and hostile campaign by 
the United States Administration which is shamelessly seeking at all 
costs to link that presence to the process of the independence of 
Namibia-directly, or through the racist South African regime, which 
has become its sounding board-as an additional means of preventing 
the implementation of the resolutions which the United Nations has 
already adopted, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the People's 
Republic of Angola and of the Republic of Cuba, on behalf of their 
respective Governments, prepared and signed a joint declaration on 4 
February 1982, with which all the Members of this international body 
are fully familiar.

198.	It is therefore fitting to recall that, at the end of the 
month of August 1981, at a lunch offered to the foreign press 
accredited in South Africa, and at the very moment when a large-scale 
aggression was being perpetrated against the People's Republic of 
Angola, the South African Prime Minister declared that the Cubans 
represent no threat to South Africa and that South Africa does not 
regard the withdrawal of the Cubans from Angola as a prior condition 
to the peaceful solution of the Namibian question.

199.	Nevertheless, it is surprising but significant that a certain 
number of those who express their concern about the presence of the 
Cuban internationalist forces in the People's Republic of Angola show 
no such concern in respect of the illegal occupation for more than a 
year of a part of the territory of Angola by the racist and Fascist 
South African troops. What moral can be drawn from that?
200.	And yet, in the course of these last nine months, the South 
African army has carried out 580 reconnaissance flights, 18 air 
bombardments, 96 landings of troops from helicopters and several 
sabotage and reprisal actions against the civilian population. The 
Angolan armed forces have suffered 31 dead, 65 wounded and 38 
missing, while the enemy forces have suffered 39 dead. Seven South 
African aircraft and three helicopters have been shot down.

201.	Thus we believe that the following positions of principle 
must be borne in mind.

202.	First, the joint Angolan-Cuban declaration states solemnly 
and unambiguously that the intention is gradually to withdraw the 
Cuban internationalist forces stationed on Angolan territory.

203.	Secondly, on 23 April 1976, a month after expelling the South 
African troops, the Angolan and Cuban Governments agreed on a 
programme progressively to reduce those forces and, in less than a 
year, the Cuban military contingent was reduced by more than one 
third. Towards the middle of 1979 the two Governments once again 
decided to implement another programme for the gradual reduction of 
the Cuban forces. Nevertheless, those two programmes had to be 
suspended at a certain point because of the growing number and scope 
of South African armed aggression against the provinces of Cunene and 
Huila. It should be emphasized that the Angolan and Cuban Governments 
spontaneously took the initiative to implement those programmes. Ho 
Government -including that of the United States of America- and no 
international organization dared to propose or demand that we do so. 
How is one then to understand the sickly insistence of the United 
States Administration on this subject and its inability to realize 
that such an attitude is a gross and inadmissible interference in the 
internal affairs of an independent and sovereign country?

204.	Thirdly, in that same joint declaration we stated that when 
the Governments of Angola and Cuba so decide, the withdrawal of Cuban 
forces stationed on Angolan territory will be carried out by a 
sovereign decision of the Government of the People's Republic of 
Angola when there is no further possibility of aggression or armed 
invasion and, in that connection, the Government of Cuba reiterated 
that it will unreservedly respect any decision taken by the sovereign 
Government of the People's Republic of Angola concerning the 
withdrawal of those forces. Once again we solemnly reaffirm before 
the Assembly what our intentions are.

205.	Furthermore, in the course of these last three months, 
American representatives in the contact group have been making a very 
special effort to spread optimism about the results already achieved 
in the negotiations that have been going on in New York since the 
month of June. In fact that is a false and ill-intentioned optimism. 
It is false, because the electoral system has not yet been defined, 
the  final composition of the United Nations forces has not yet been 
decided, and the cease-fire between SWAPO and the Pretoria regime, 
which will constitute the essential point of departure for the 
implementation of the United Nations plan, in accordance with 
Security Council resolution 435 (1978), seem to us to be far from 
being anticipated

or applied. It is ill-intentioned in that the American Administration 
has started a manoeuvre to attribute to the People's Republic of 
Angola responsibility for the delay of, or even for preventing, a 
swift and adequate solution of the process of independence for 
Namibia owing to the position of the Government of Angola regarding 
linkage and the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces. In 
point of fact, this manoeuvre constitutes an escape hatch for those 
who are or will be the ones really responsible for such a situation.

206.	Thus, since the position of the Government of Angola is a 
legitimate one the heads of State and Government of the front-line 
States meeting at Lusaka on 4 September 1982:

  ... noted with indignation that a new element has been introduced by 
the United States of America in seeking to link the negotiations for 
the independence of Namibia to the withdrawal of Cuban forces from 
Angora. In this respect, the Summit emphasized without any ambiguity 
the importance of separating the decolonization process of Namibia 
from the stationing of Cuban forces in Angola. The insistence on 
maintaining this linkage is contrary to the spirit and the letter of 
[Security Council] resolution 435 (1978) and can only hamper the 
negotiating process. Furthermore, this insistence constitutes 
interference in Angola's internal affairs. In this context, they 
expressed their complete support for the Angolan position on the 
question, which is clearly defined in the joint declaration of the 
Governments of the People's Republic of Angola and of the Republic of 
Cuba, of 4 February 1982. Accordingly, they rejected any attempt to 
make the People's Republic of Angola responsible for any delay in the 
prompt conclusion of the negotiations on the independence of Namibia. 
They strongly condemned the aggression and invasion of Angola by 
South African forces and demanded that the Pretoria regime cease all 
acts of aggression and withdraw its troops from Angola.

207.	A similar position was taken during the Third Conference of 
Heads of State of the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of 
Cape Verde, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, the People's Republic of 
Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, 
which was held in the capital of Cape Verde on 21 and 22 September 
1982.

208.	May I be allowed to remind the Assembly of the enormous 
sacrifices which the heroic people of Angola has already made and the 
extremely high price it is paying in thousands of lost human lives 
and material damage amounting to more than $7.5 billion.

209.	I should like once again to remind the Assembly of the 
proposal made at the thirty-first session by the Angolan Government 
for consideration by the general  Assembly, that an international 
fund for the national reconstruction of Angola be established, 
amounting to approximately $300 million. It is sad to note that so 
just a proposal has not received the least attention from this world 
body, despite the fact that in its resolution 475 (1980) the Security 
Council requested  Member States urgently to extend all necessary 
assistance to the People's
Republic of Angola and the other front-line States,  and called for 
'the payment by South Africa of full and adequate compensation to the 
People's Republic of Angola for the damage to life ard property 
resulting from these acts of aggression.  May we renew our hopes that 
this bitter cry will be heard?

210. Everyone knows that in South Africa the internal situation is 
progressively deteriorating as the conflicts within the hideous 
regime and the ruling party grow worse, and the valiant fighters of 
the African National Congress [ANC] steadfastly and heroically carry 
out political and military; their efforts are recognized even by the 
Pretoria regime, and this has led to an escalation of threats and 
aggression, as well as an increasing use of mercenary forces and 
bandit groups-trained, financed, organized and commanded by South 
Africa-against the People's Republic of Mozambique. It has also led 
to acts of aggression perpetrated against the Republics of Zimbabwe 
and Zambia 2nd the Kingdom of Lesotho. All States Members of the 
United Nations should firmly condemn these actions and should stand 
in active solidarity with the ANC and the front-line States.

21L With regard to Western Sahara, we reiterate our unflinching 
solidarity with the heroic Sahraoui people, which, under the 
leadership of its sole authentic representative, the POLISARIO Front, 
is victoriously pursuing its armed struggle against Moroccan 
occupation to recover full independence and territorial integrity. We 
welcome the admission of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to the 
OAU, and we reiterate our conviction that there trust be direct 
negotiations between the two conflicting parties in the search for a 
political solution.

212.	With regard to the temporary difficulties now being 
experienced by the OAU, we consider that any problems that might 
affect us should be discussed by us alone, within our continental 
organization, and without any interference from outside Africa, as 
has been noted. The fact that the thirty-eighth ordinary session of 
the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held at Addis Ababa in February 
1982, and the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State 
and Government of the OAU, at Tripoli, held in August 1982, were 
obstructed is a part of the strategy of American imperialism and some 
of its allies aimed at subjugating or paralysing international bodies 
which play an active role in the struggle for the political and 
economic independence of peoples. We are absolutely convinced that 
this momentary crisis will soon be overcome.

213.	We are deeply moved by the bloody events in Lebanon. The 
brutal armed invasion carried out by the racist and fascist Tel Aviv 
regime, with the full and shameful connivance of the United States 
Administration and the inadmissible passivity of certain Arab States; 
the genocide of Palestinians and Lebanese in west Beirut; and the 
massacre, the carnage, at Sabra and Shatila: these can never be 
forgotten, and call for our strongest condemnation and an appropriate 
response in due course.

214.	We are firmly convinced that the Palestinian people and its 
sole legitimate representative, the PLO, will resume the fight after 
having, by their heroic resistance during the fierce battles of those 
73 historic days, won the respect andadmiration of all those who 
stand with the peoples struggling for their independence. We reaffirm 
our unswerving solidarity with the Palestinian people and the PLO as 
they carry on their struggle to recover their usurped homeland and to 
establish an independent State there.

215.	After seven years of Indonesian military occupation, the 
people of East Timor, under the leadership of its vanguard 
organization and legitimate representative, the Frente Revolucionaria 
de Timor Leste Independente, continues its heroic resistance, in 
spite of the lack of solidarity on the part of some countries of the 
non-aligned movement. Those countries should identify themselves with 
the struggle of the people of East Timor, out of respect for the 
fundamental principles of non-alignment.

216.	The inability of the Indonesian army to stamp out the armed 
liberation struggle of the people of East Timor clearly shows that 
people's rejection of integrate into or annexation by Indonesia of 
its homeland. The 35,000 Indonesian soldiers present there, recourse 
to helicopter-borne forces to try to destroy the fighting forces of 
FRETILIN, which control 70 per cent of the national territory, the 
terror and famine imposed on the people of East Timor -will all fail 
to thwart the nationalist feelings of that people or its resolve to 
fight. Yet more than 200,000 persons have been massacred by the 
troops of a self-styled non-aligned country which never fought 
against the former administering Power, Portugal, during the colonial 
period.

217.	The Indonesian troops, and thus the Indonesian Government, 
are today carrying out an appalling genocide, through physical 
liquidation, cultural repression, deportation, and repopulation with 
thousands of Javanese citizens. But there are the beginnings of 
resistance in the Indonesian army against participating in operations 
aimed at eliminating the patriots of East Timor. This is proved by 
the recent refusal to act of two battalions, which are today isolated 
on one of the islands of the country.

218.	It only needed Portugal to shirk its responsibilities towards 
the people of East Timor by not proceeding to the transfer of power 
to the FRETILIN leaders for Indonesia to invade and militarily occupy 
part of East Timor and the outskirts of the capital, where its 
military contingents had established themselves.

219.	Ever since the thirtieth session of the general Assembly the 
Organization has been expressing deep concern over the situation 
obtaining in East Timor as a result of the intervention of Indonesian 
armed forces and has been requesting the Indonesian Government to 
withdraw without delay its forces from the Territory in order to 
enable the people of East Timor freely to exercise their right to 
self-determination and independence, as provided in general Assembly 
resolution 3485 (XXX). Security Council resolutions 384 (1975) and 
389 (1976) once again call on the Indonesian Government to withdraw 
its forces from the Territory forthwith. Resolution 36/50, adopted at 
the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly, reaffirms the same 
principles and makes the same requests. The Indonesian Government, 
however, shows no sign of willingness to respect United Nations 
decisions. It is therefore imperative that States Members of the 
United Nations, in particular those which are members of the 
non-aligned movement, do not endorse the brutal annexation of East 
Timor to Indonesia, a country which does not even respect our 
resolutions.

220.	Bearing in mind that the Government of Portugal seems to wish 
to resume its responsibilities as the former administering Power in 
order to bring the tragedy of the people of East Timor to the 
attention of the international community, we wish to express 
encouragement for the request of the Government of Portugal aimed at 
satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Democratic 
Republic of East Timor.

221.	With regard to developments in the situation in the 
Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, in the People's Republic of 
Kampuchea, in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and in the 
Republic of Cyprus, we reaffirm our active solidarity with those 
peoples in their respective causes and our support for the positions 
of their Governments in the quest for just and appropriate solutions.

222.	With regard to Latin America, we reaffirm our militant 
solidarity with the Salvadorian people and with its legitimate 
representatives, the Revolutionary Democratic Front and the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front in their just struggles against the 
present regime in El Salvador, and we heartily welcome the victories 
they have already won.

223.	We wish to reaffirm our solidarity with the Cuban people in 
their revolution. We support their efforts to overcome the 
consequences of the criminal economic boycott imposed by American 
imperialism, in flagrant violation of human rights, and we denounce 
the aggression and the threats against the Cuban people. We welcome 
also the revolutionary process of the peoples of Nicaragua and 
Grenada and their determination to face the serious threats that hang 
over them. We also reaffirm our active solidarity with the Puerto 
Rican people and denounce the imperialist manoeuvres which, by means 
of despicable political and economic pressures, have prevented the 
inclusion of the question of Puerto Rico in the agenda.

224.	No one is unaware of the fact that the Security Council and 
General Assembly as well as the OAU have already adopted several 
resolutions on mercenarism, condemning the activities of mercenaries, 
their recruitment and their use for the purpose of destabilizing 
actions in underdeveloped countries, particularly on the African 
continent. While it is true that a Convention for the Elimination of 
Mercenarism in Africa has already been adopted by the OAU-and the 
People's Republic of Angola, which has suffered and continues to 
suffer the misdeeds of mercenaries, is proud of the important 
contribution it made to that Convention-it is imperative, none the 
less, for the General Assembly to adopt as soon as possible an 
international convention prohibiting the recruitment, use, financing 
and training of mercenaries and the provision of transit facilities 
to them. Indeed, we hope that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of 
an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing 
and Training of Mercenaries, established under general  Assembly 
resolution 35/48, will fulfil its mandate and that such a convention 
with finally be adopted.

225.	Next month the Angolan people will celebrate the seventh 
anniversary of the proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola, 
under the dynamic and visionary leadership of Comrade Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos, President of the MPLA-Labour Party and President of the 
Republic. Important results have already been achieved in 
consolidating the Angolan revolutionary process, in setting up the 
structures of the party, in strengthening national unity and defence 
and in laying the foundations for a socialist society in the People's 
Republic of Angola.

226.	Unfortunately, however, the Angolan Government has had to 
devote most of its human and material resources to the defence of its 
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, because of the 
continuous acts of aggression by the racist and Fascist regime of 
Pretoria. This has seriously affected the economic and social 
development we had planned, but if we are to attain that paramount 
goal the undeclared war against us must be brought to an end. We need 
peace, and we dare to hope that that peace so fervently desired by 
the Angolan people will be attained in the coming year.

227.	The struggle continues. Victory is certain.
"
AGO,1989,"﻿
Mr. President, today I have the honour of addressing the General Assembly for the first time and I wish to extend greetings to you both personally and on behalf of the People's Republic of Angola and best wishes for your success during this forty-fourth session of the Assembly. We are certain that your abilities aid diplomatic experience will contribute significantly to its success.
We should like also to express our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina, who conducted the previous session with brilliance and foresight, contributing, as we all know, to its success.
To the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, we extend our most sincere congratulations, especially on his exemplary performance in the process leading to the search for peace and prosperity for all mankind despite all the political, economic and other problems that the Organization faces.
Only a few days have elapsed since the ninth summit conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which was held in a spirit of modernization. That conference took place at a time when positive changes were occurring in international relations. This is a situation that pleases us because we can now say that the period of the cold war is over. The super-Powers seem to have established between themselves a relationship directed towards ending confrontation and leading to a gradual reduction and dismantling of their respective arsenals, including nuclear arms. 
These negotiations between the major world Powers on the limitation of arms and on disarmament should be encouraged and supported by every current of opinion in our countries and around the world, as the right to choose between war and world peace should not be restricted to one country or to a small group of countries.
Peace is the patrimony of all mankind, which must fight in a United bloc in order to preserve it. Peace is the indispensable and necessary condition for development and for the building of happiness aid well-being for all people. Peace, stability and security are inseparable, and since we live an interdependent world: Id the active commitment of all coin tries is necessary for the resolution of world problems.
The results reached at the Reykjavik talks opened important prospects for peace for peoples all over the world and emphasized an already strong tendency towards the relaxation of tension in international relations and for the use of dialogue and negotiation as a means to resolve differences, end conflicts and eliminate those points of tension that exist in many parts of the globe.
This new tendency has encouraged the peoples of Africa to engage in a courageous struggle for the liquidation of the last remnants of colonialism and racism. Aware of this reality, the South African regime, supported by some Western Powers, has engaged in armed aggression and acts of sabotage, combining direct action with the participation of mercenaries and puppet groups against the countries in the region, with the dual objective of thwarting the struggle of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa, under the respective guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWATO) and the African National Congress (ANC), their sole and legitimate representatives, and of destabilizing sovereign southern African countries in order to promote subversion and create conditions for the imposition of neo-colonial Governments submissive to the wishes of the Western Powers.
The Peopled Republic of Angola, as a country fighting to win the battle against underdevelopment at all costs in order to improve the social conditions and standards of living of its people  could not isolate itself from the political context of its region. Out contribution to the solution of the problems that affect the southern region of our continent has been provided within the context of the front-line countries  to which our country has given significant support in the political and diplomatic actions undertaken to find a just solution to the problem of the decolonisation of Namibia and the elimination of the vicious apartheid system. Because of this attitude  Angola has been the victim of constant armed aggression. 
This climate of extreme armed violence generated by the South African aggressors has resulted in remarkable deeds by the Angolans - such as the victorious battles of Cuito Canavale, Tchipa, Calueque and Ruacana -· which will remain as glorious pages in the history of our resistance against the invader. In this hard struggle the Angolan people was able to count on the active commitment of Cuba and on the support of the international community, for which we are most grateful.
The Government of the People's Republic of Angola has given proof of good faith and understanding in the search for the means to solve its internal conflict. In a constructive spirit, and as a clear demonstration of its peaceful policy, the Angolan Government on 22 June this year, in the presence of 18 African Heads of State at a meeting held at Gbadolite, in the Republic of Zaire, agreed upon a cessation of military hostilities, to become effective on 24 June 1989. That followed intensive consultations with various African countries regarding a series of principles that were included in the peace plan for Angola.
The President of the Republic of Zaire informed us that he had established contacts with Savimbi and UNITA and that they had accepted the principles for the settlement of the internal problem in Angola. Those principles are·, first, cessation of external interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola. Secondly, cessation of hostilities in all parts of the national territory, including the area around the Benguela railway, which will be considered a peace zone, and therefore used only for peaceful protest thirdly, observation of the provisions of constitutional law aid other fundamental legislation; fourthly. Integration of UNITA militants into the structure of the State', and into other institutions, according to their capabilities; and, fifthly, acceptance of a temporary, voluntary removal of Jonas Savimbi from the Angolan political scene. 
Unfortunately, since the Gbadolite summit events have not proceeded at the same pace or developed positively, since the UNITA rebels have not stopped their terrorist acts or their hostile statements and propaganda against the legitimate Government of Angola. Moreover, their traditional allies have not ceased their interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola. It must be remembered that we are involved in a peace process, which is not promoted by the supply of arms and increased financial aid to Jonas Savintbi.
The fact that certain groups of Angolans serve as instruments for the realization of the Pretoria regime's aims in the war of aggression against Angola shows that the war against our country has an external origin. Therefore, we regret that despite all the commitments freely made by Angola - not only in the comprehensive negotiations platform of 17 November 1984, but also in the Geneva Protocol of 5 August 1988 and in the bilateral agreement between Angola and Cuba of 22 December 1988 on the withdrawal of the Cuban military contingent from the People's Republic of Angola - the UNITA rebels, in spite of the cease-fire agreed upon in Gbadolite, have carried out various attacks and ambushes. Up to the end of August there had been 2 85 attacks against the civilian population and the armed forces, 199 ambushes, 127 anti-personnel and mine explosions, the destruction of 58 personnel carriers by mine explosions, 67 abductions, 56 cases of looting, 1,226 deaths, 2,071 wounded, 705 disappeared, one Brazilian citizen wounded, one Filipino citizen assassinated, 135 houses destroyed, 263 cats destroyed and 1,107 head of cattle stolen.
That is the clearest evidence of the dangerous conduct of UNITA, which has thus proved to continue to be a destabilizing element, not only internally, in Angola, but also in the region as a whole.  Furthermore, the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has supported all those initiatives that would contribute, de facto, to the elimination of disagreement and war, in the interest of defending the inalienable rights of peoples to independence, sovereignty and the free choice of their political system.
Racist South Africa, playing the role of gendarme in our region, is economically destabilizing the front-line countries, and especially the People's Republics of Angola and Mozambique. The actions of the bandits paid by South Africa are aimed at ensuring the realization of those objectives, and have nothing to do with the interests of the Angolan people. For that reason, their preferred targets are the social and economic infrastructure and the villages of peaceful citizens, where the greatest barbarities are committed. 
Beating in mind the fundamental role played by the United Nations, the Government of Angola has been informing the Secretary-General, Mt. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and the Member countries about the evolution of the situation in southern Africa in general and in particular in my own country. The Secretary-General's visits to Angola have made it possible for the highest representative of this international institution personally to witness the extent of foreign aggression and the reasons for out resort to the right of self-defence.
We have had the opportunity to reiterate to the Secretary-General our position regarding the origin of the conflict that has devastated our sub region and those responsible for it. My Government, within its already proven policy of flexibility and respect for the principles that govern relations between States, has presented serious proposals for the re-establishment of peace in southern Africa.
Ws believe that once the apartheid system in South Africa has been dismantled out region will enter a period of peace, necessary for the development aid progress of its peoples, which will be conducive to regional and international co-operation. Particularly with the independence of Namibia, which we all hope will be achieved within the schedule initially established.
The Angolan Government will not fail to make every effort in the search for a political solution to the problem of apartheid, through talks between the Government in Pretoria, the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other valid political forces in South Africa.
In fact, today the situation in Namibia presents a different scenario. With the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) an irreversible process was set in motion, beginning in April this year. We hope that it will bring an end to the last stronghold of colonialism on the African continent, despite the acts of intimidation against the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) militants and sympathizers by the Koevoet forces integrated into the South West Africa Police, which continue to carry out their activities, especially in northern Namibia. The Koevoet continues to employ tactics of counter-insurgency as well as destabilization in the south of Angola, in collaboration with the demobilized elements of the former territorial troops - the South West Africa Territory Force - especially battalions 54, 101, 201 and 202, which are stationed along the Angola-Namibia border aid which maintain close ties with UNITA, in a clear violation of the tripartite agreement.
The People's Republic of Angola reiterates its total commitment to complying with the New York agreements, as long as there is a corresponding compliance by the other patties aid the efforts made for Namibia's transition from colonialism to independence are made under conditions of stability and justice, lb this end, in accordance with the New York agreements regarding peace in south-west Africa; we should like to refer on the one hand to the more than 22,600 internationalists from Cuba who have already returned to their country and on the other hand to the SWAPO elements which ate new, as was agreed, north of parallel 16 and under the control of the United Nations representative in Angola. 
The efforts of the Secretary-General in search of a just negotiated solution to the conflict concerning Western Sahara have merited the encouragement of the Angolan Government. We hope the contacts between His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco and the POŁISARIO Front will continue opening the way for the implementation of the United Nations and Organization of African Unity resolutions on this matter.
A matter of equal importance to the people and the Government of Angola is that of the Maubere people, which has struggled for 14 years against the foreign occupation of its territory. We reaffirm once again our appreciation of the position taken by the Portuguese Government as administering Power of that Territory, and we urge the Secretary-General to make every effort in the search for a just and lasting solution based on the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Territory and relevant United Nations resolutions.
We must commend the efforts of the Korean people towards the peaceful reunification of their country, without foreign intervention based on dialogue and consultations between North and South, in compliance with the principles established in the Joint North-South Declaration of 4 July 1972.
We salute the positive developments towards resolution of the situation in Kampuchea, reflected in the actions of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in withdrawing its forces stationed in Kampuchea.
Following the April 1988 Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan, we called upon the signatories to fulfil their commitments with a view to establishing a climate of peace, security and stability in South-East Asia.
We encourage the Central American States to continue on the path they have chosen to find negotiated political solutions. We are convinced that the peace agreements recently concluded in Honduras will greatly contribute to the implementation of the Esquipulas II agreements. We reiterate our active solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people which under the aegis of the Palestine Liberation Organization is waging a tenacious struggle for the liberation of its territory and for the establishment of an independent State comprising the entire territory of Palestine  including Jerusalem.
We support the efforts of the tripartite committee created by the League of Arab States to seek a negotiated political solution to the fratricidal conflict in Lebanon.
We are sure that sufficient change will take place to permit peace to be restored in all regions of the planet where war situations persist and to ensure that respect for the rights of peoples and States to freedom and independence will lead to a common path of economic and social development.
In speaking of the role played by the United Nations, one cannot overlook the highly positive contribution of the non-aligned countries and their Movement, which has greatly influenced action in favour of halting the arms race, reducing nuclear and conventional arsenals aid gradually easing pockets of regional tension.
We find ourselves at the end of yet another decade unfortunately characterized by deep stagnation with respect to the economic development of our countries. In some countries the economic situation is even worse than that of 20 years ago. Since the Common Fund for commodities, under the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, came into effect last June, a few successes have been achieved in the field of international trade. While these are not significant enough to efface the spectre of the weak results obtained, they encourage us in our long, hard-fought struggle for the establishment of a new international economic order.
It is for that reason that we want to reaffirm our total commitment to the holding next April of a special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation, and in particular on revitalizing economic growth and development, which will undoubtedly constitute an important step towards the adoption of a new international development strategy which we all hope will produce better results than previous ones.
As we again examine the current economic situation in our countries we ate compelled to express our great concern with respect to the worsening of the problems faced by the international financial system and the consequences for our countries' already weak economies. Huge loans, along with high interest rates and the unprecedented fall in commodity prices, have aggravated the problem of the foreign debt of developing countries, a problem which has placed those countries in such an absurd situation that they are today repaying more to the developed countries and international financial institutions that they receive in loans. In my view that situation cannot continue because it threatens the social, economic and even political feasibility of our existence as States. We therefore consider it timely and urgent that an international conference be held on financial and monetary questions for the solution of this crucial problem.
When we gathered recently in Belgrade at the latest summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, we recognized that increased South-South co-operation is vital as one way to ease the present economic crisis - not as an alternative to co-operation with the North, which is also a priority, but as a means of finding other solutions to this problem, a problem that faces us all and threatens the existence of all.
It is also paramount now to devote special attention to the African continent, where the critical economic situation of its States has reached unprecedented levels. Hunger, malnutrition, epidemic diseases and natural disasters have made any attempt at economic development impossible, to the point where 26 of the 36 least developed countries in the world are on the African continent. 
We deplore the weak commitment of the international community, which has made it impossible for the United Nations Programme of action for African Economic Recovery and Development to succeed despite the efforts made by African countries, in some case with enormous social sacrifices. Added to those factors is the enormous foreign debt the continent faces today, a debt that has already exceeded the astronomic sum of 3230 billion, forcing most African countries into a level of debt servicing that is incompatible with their development needs.
The increasing deterioration of the environment, the depletion of the ozone layer and, especially, the flow towards developing countries of toxic wastes ""exported"" by developed countries have in recent years been the focus of attention by the international community. The People's Republic of Angola unconditionally condemns all such negative activities, which are incompatible with the already critical economic development of those countries. We stress the importance, indeed the urgency, of holding a second conference on environment and development, since we believe it would provide an ideal opportunity to deal jointly with these questions.
The People's Republic of Angola, located in the southern part of the African continent, unfortunately cannot escape the critical economic situation facing that continent. The People's Republic of Angola has recently joined the International Monetary Fund as a full member of that important international financial institution. We should like to take this opportunity to excess our deepest appreciation to all the countries which, though their contributions, made it possible for us to join. We do not deny the importance of joining the International Monetary Fund, particularly as this relates to the successful implementation of our economic and financial recovery programme, which we in the People's Republic of Angola have been implementing for several years. The economic recovery programme of our com try places priority on restructuring the foreign debt valued at 94,966 million, and on the rescheduling of the terms of repayment in order to re-establish the financial flow of exports and to make possible a global volume of trade compatible with the domestic levels of consumption and projected investments.
The programme concentrates equally on attracting foreign investment, which will be principally directed toward the export rather than the import sector, with a view to restoring production and increasing wages and the availability of consumer goods. The People's Republic of Angola is a country with enormous economic potential, and we trust that we can make further advances in those areas and in continued pursuit of better living conditions for our people.
In conclusion, we should like to take this opportunity to launch an appeal to the international community for at increase in its support and material aid to the programmes the People's Republic of Angola is implementing to counter the effects of the war that can still be felt in our country and losses that now exceed 912 billion. The emergency situation in the People's Republic of Angola has been rendered more acute by a drought in its southern region and floods in the north.
In that context, a conference on the emergency situation was held in Angola on 22 September, the positive results of which will be a symbolic contribution towards minimizing the difficulties affecting the sectors of public health and agriculture, which most urgently require supplementary assistance.
Allow me, Mr. President, to reiterate our best wishes for success in the proceedings of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly, end to assure you of the Angolan delegation's co-operation in any way that may be necessary. 
"
AGO,1977,"﻿42.	 Almost one year ago, the young People's Republic of Angola was historically and officially admitted as a full Member to the United Nations. The time that has since elapsed has not yet been sufficient to efface from the Angolan people's memory the struggle waged by their revolutionary vanguard against the anachronistic, anti-democratic and hostile attitude taken by the United States of America in the Security Council when it delayed and vetoed the admission to the United Nations of the People's Republic of Angola.
43.	On 1 December 1976, when the People's Republic of Angola for the first time made its voice heard from this rostrum, it was stated that our admission to this world body was not just a victory for the Angolan people: it was a victory for all peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples, - a victory for all the progressive forces and countries which supported our long and hard national liberation struggle. But it was an incomplete victory, because we were not at the same time celebrating the admission of the glorious Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Today, however, the picture of that victory is complete, and tomorrow it will assume even greater proportions with the inevitable admission of other independent countries.
44.	Permit us now, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Angola, to extend our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly and to wish you every success in the fulfilment of your arduous task.
45.	We should like to convey to the President of the thirty-first session our appreciation of the outstanding services he rendered during the period in which he was invested with the same high responsibilities, and »5so to express to the Secretary-General of the United Nations our deep gratitude for the great dedication he has brought to the solution of various grave problems with which both the People's Republic of Angola and the international community have had to deal.
46.	The foreign policy of the People's Republic of Angola is governed by unequivocal guiding principles, which we should like to recall and indeed to reaffirm: the establishment and maintenance of diplomatic relations with all countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, non- aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equal and reciprocal advantage, peaceful coexistence and non- alignment; respect for the principles of the Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity; the intransigent safeguarding of our complete national independence and of our socialist option; the diversification of relations of co-operation in the most varied fields; militant solidarity with the national liberation movements, with oppressed peoples and with the struggle of the workers of the whole world, on the basis of proletarian internationalism; and the progressive strengthening of bonds of friendship and co-operation with the socialist community and anti-imperialist communities of every continent.
47.	However, despite the clarity and indeed the universality of most of the principles enunciated, the People's Republic of Angola and hence the Angolan people are still faced with a lack of any kind of understanding, with accusations and labels 'with biased press campaigns, with divisive manoeuvring and multiform offensives orchestrated by the imperialist Powers with the connivance of external and internal agents, all aimed at the annihilation of the revolutionary process now in progress, the establishment of neo-colonialism and the consequent paralysis of the liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, with grave consequences for the other front-line States.
48.	The Government of the People's Republic of Angola will not fail therefore to speak out in accordance with the principles that guide it, or to act with the authority and responsibility vested in it so as duly to comply with the duties and obligations it has assumed vis-à-vis the Angolan people and the progressive international community. By this we mean that we intend to face problems objectively and not to resort to compromise merely as a way of finding provisional solutions or of concealing a lack of political courage in the face of the complexity or delicate nature of some situation or another. This implies that we shall clearly, honestly and courageously assume the responsibilities of our positions and options.
49.	The present state of international political affairs is essentially characterized by a multiplicity of conflicts of different types. No one in this Assembly can or should be unaware that the growing contradiction between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp has shifted the scene of military confrontation from South-East Asia to the African continent, where, as a result of the resounding defeat of North American imperialism in Viet Nam and the collapse of the Portuguese colonial empire, an offensive is being mounted by certain imperialist Powers in the form of indirect intervention, the immediate effect of which is the destabilization of progressive African regimes.
50.	A brief analysis of the international panorama shows that the direct confrontation of the peoples with imperialism, neo-colonialism, colonialism, Zionism, apartheid and the exploitation of man by man is still an incontestable reality in the present era. Peace is therefore far from being assured in all parts of the world, because we are still witnessing a frenzied arms race, the perpetuation of colonial wars, all manner of aggression against independent States, foreign domination and occupation, economic plunder and a proliferation of plots by the imperialist Powers against the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of States.
51.	At the same time, and in particular, the shameful armed aggression against Benin; the heinous assassination of the President of the People's Republic of the Congo, Marien Ngouabi; the criminal attempted coup d’état in Angola organized by a group of factionalists serving foreign interests; the armed aggression and incursions carried out by the racist and Fascist regimes ""of so-called Rhodesia and South Africa against Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana and Angola; the military conflicts between contiguous African countries; the fostering of subversion and counterrevolution in certain African countries; the troop movements north and south of Angola's borders; the financial, material and even logistic support given to Angolan puppet organizations, and so forth—all this is a very clear indication of the aggressive designs of international imperialism on the African continent.
52.	In view of this somewhat gloomy picture, and in order better to face up to imperialist manoeuvres, it seems to us essential that there should be joint action, particularly within the framework of the movement of non-aligned countries, whereby each nation would ensure its complete national independence by taking national resources into its own hands and exploiting them for the benefit of its people; reject any form of subordination and dependence and any interference or pressure whatsoever, whether of a political, an economic or a military nature; prohibit the establishment of foreign military bases on its national territory and support all those fighting for the dismantling of such bases, which are generally imposed or maintained against the will of the people; seriously devote every effort to a necessary and effective international detente, to general and complete disarmament, and to the implementation of measures designed to strengthen international security and to ensure a total ban on the production and use of any kind of chemical, bacteriological or nuclear weapons, including the neutron bomb; prevent by every means the Indian Ocean from becoming the scene of any military confrontation and contribute decisively to its maintenance as a zone of peace; put into effect, as far as possible, development programmes which can be defended against economic blocs; and firmly support genuine national liberation movements in every possible way.
53.	However, one of the most serious problems to be faced over the coming years, especially for under-developed countries, will undoubtedly be the economic crisis in the capitalist world, essentially characterized by rising inflation and growing unemployment, by the diminished level of real profits from the export of commodities from underdeveloped countries and the growing indebtedness of those same countries.
54.	In the face of this situation, which basically affects the countries of the so-called third world, practical ways must be devised of applying the oft-repeated principles concerning the establishment of a new world economic order founded essentially on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and co-operation between States.
55.	It has therefore become necessary to act in such a way as effectively to create a new equilibrium in international economic relations based on social justice, human dignity and the inalienable right of peoples to exercise total and permanent sovereignty over their national resources and freely to use and dispose of those resources.
56.	In the course of two years of independence, the Angolan people and the Government of the People's Republic of Angola, under the leadership of the Movimento Popular de Libertagao de Angola  and of their far-sighted leader, Mr. Agostinho Neto, have managed to overcome a series of difficulties and obstacles. With each passing day and month, they become ever more involved in the great and inspiring battle for national reconstruction in order to respond more adequately to the interests of the most exploited strata and to build a truly socialist society. At the same time they are preparing for an event of great historical significance: the holding of the first Congress of the MPLA and the creation of the party of the working class.
57.	Despite the invasions from the north and the south by the regular armies of Zaire and South Africa, together with bands of puppets and mercenaries supported by certain Western Powers and certain French-speaking African countries; despite the destruction and plunder carried out by those same forces, with material damages estimated at S6,700 million, for which compensation has not yet been paid; and despite the flight and departure of technical cadres, most of them Portuguese—all factors which caused the paralysis of internal trade and of industrial and agricultural units and the consequent sudden sharp decline in production—it is absolutely undeniable that quite positive and encouraging result have already been achieved, especially in the fields of education, health, agriculture, industry, fisheries, construction, the economy, internal and external trade, and national defence.
58.	In this respect, there is still a state of emergency in the People's Republic of Angola, and the tremendous efforts made in the task of national reconstruction have not as yet made it possible to attain the production levels reached in 1973, the last year of Portuguese colonial domination.
59.	For all the foregoing reasons, the so-called gross national product in the People's Republic of Angola is today very much lower than S300-that is, S250 per capita. Hence, we have good reason to regard ourselves as being among the least developed countries, and we are justified in our appeals for assistance to many types of international bodies and, in particular, to the specialized agencies of the United Nations.
60.	For the activity already carried out in the People's Republic of Angola by those specialized agencies, we must express our most sincere gratitude, particularly to UNDP and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for the volume of assistance - and for the projects carried out or now in progress We express the same feelings of gratitude to all the countries and organizations which in this respect have, directly or indirectly, contributed to lessening the sufferings and the sacrifices of the Angolan people.
61.	Because it is our understanding that the consolidation of the independence of the People's Republic of Angola should now lead to a more substantial contribution to the national liberation struggle of peoples still subject to colonial domination, and because we consider that the armed struggle waged by the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, the so-called Western Sahara and East Timor is still the most valid way for them to achieve their inalienable right to independence, we have, out of the most elementary spirit of militant solidarity and internationalist duty, assumed the responsibility of giving our support, in every possible way and in accordance with our modest possibilities, to their legitimate representatives, namely, SWAPO, the Patriotic Front, the African National Congress, the Frente POLISARIO and the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente.
62.	However, there are certain considerations which come to our mind. In the first place, the various forms of support given to the Fascist and racist Pretoria and Salisbury regimes by the imperialist and neo-colonialist Powers, in particular the United States of America, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom, such as the sale or supply of arms or military equipment, financial investment, the refusal to observe the embargo on arms and oil supplies and other decreed sanctions, and the provision of nuclear technology and the requisite equipment, constitute clear acts of aggression against the peoples of southern Africa and against the United Nations itself.
63.	While it is true that we do not reject a priori the possibility of creating favourable conditions in Namibia and Zimbabwe for a negotiated settlement on the independence of those territories, it is no less true that we do not yet believe that a just solution to the existing antagonism can be found merely through talks between the so-called ""group of five"" and the Vorster regime—in the case of Namibia—or through the already rejected Anglo-American plan, in the case of Zimbabwe. Moreover, we still cannot conceive of the supporters of such regime really being able to convert themselves into sincere champions of the aspirations of the Namibian and Zimbabwean peoples.
64.	In this connexion, we should like to recall that, as clearly stated by the President of the MPLA and of the People's Republic of Angola:
"".. . only through armed struggle is it possible to defeat the oppressive forces in the world. It is not through negotiations, through conferences or councils, that the peoples will determine their own future, because there is a struggle of interests, a struggle between classes now developed through imperialism and through the desire of one social group to dominate all the others. It was armed struggle that led to the talks in Switzerland and it was armed struggle which brought the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia to the forefront. Without armed struggle, the national liberation struggles would have no vigour. It must therefore be intensified.""
65.	What will be decisive for the People's Republic of Angola, however, will be the positions or decisions taken in the near future by SWAPO and the Patriotic Front.
66.	Within the context of support for the armed struggle for national liberation, we consider that the democratic and progressive forces in the international community cannot remain indifferent or sit by with folded arms, as we have already openly stated, either with regard to the difficult and legitimate struggle of the Saharan people under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO, or with regard to the equally hard and legitimate struggle of the people of East Timor, led by FRETILIN, for their legitimate right to self-determination and independence. After the withdrawal of the former colonial Powers and in the light of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, it is inconceivable that, in the face of a certain conniving passivity, those two liberation movements should find themselves obliged to fight, weapons in hand, against foreign armed forces belonging to certain countries which are members of the non-aligned movement and which did not take up arms during the period of Spanish and Portuguese occupation. It seems to us indispensable that the State members of 041) and of the United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples should assume, with urgency, their responsibilities.
67.	In the context of solidarity with other struggling peoples, we should like once again to reaffirm our unconditional support for the Arab people of Palestine and their legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization, in their struggle against Zionism to recover their national rights and their homeland, which has been usurped by Israel. At the same time we support the full right of the Palestine Liberation Organization to take part in all negotiations concerning the solution of the situation in the Middle East. The absence of that Organization and the attempt to push it aside will make it impossible ever to halt or eliminate the conflict. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Korean people in their persistent efforts to reunify their country by peaceful means without any foreign interference in their internal affairs; and we again reaffirm our unreserved support for the people of Puerto Rico in their just struggle for their full right to self- determination and independence and against the annexation of the country to the territory of North America. We also reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Chilean people in their determined struggle to regain their freedom, their independence and their human dignity.
68.	The Angolan people and their revolutionary vanguard, MPLA, who wish only to live in peace within their geographical boundaries, are conscious of their national and international duties, as well as of the dangers that surround them and the acts of aggression that are. being prepared against the People's Republic of Angola.
69.	The Angolan people and their leading bodies are not unaware of the grave threats to which they are subject, coming on the one hand from the Zairian regime, which, apart from everything else, recently concluded a contract with the Orbital Transport and Raketen Company of the Federal Republic of Germany and, on the other hand, from the South African regime, which continues to train bands of puppets on Namibian territory and to infiltrate armed groups into Angolan territory to spread death and destruction among the population on the border, while their mentors, without the slightest scruple or even the least sense of the ridiculous, proclaim in certain European, American and African capitals that such and such provinces in the country have been occupied, although no one has seen them even in a commune or municipality
70.	The consequences of these designs, which can prove disastrous, are already the full responsibility of certain Governments of Western Powers and of certain French- speaking African countries.
71.	In reaffirming our profound gratitude for the militant solidarity extended to the Angolan people by the socialist countries, particularly the Soviet Union and Cuba, and by progressive African countries and the democratic forces in general, we wish to assure the Assembly that nothing can deflect the Angolan people from the revolutionary course they have freely chosen.
72.	The struggle continues. Victory is certain.
 


"
AGO,2005,"It is with great
honour that I take this floor before this Assembly. At
the outset, I should like to congratulate the President,
on behalf of the Government of the Republic of
Angola, for his election to the presidency of the
sixtieth session of the General Assembly of our
Organization.
I also wish to express my appreciation to his
predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for his commitment and for
the transparent and efficient manner in which he
presided over the fifty-ninth session of General
Assembly.
Today, 60 years after the foundation of the United
Nations, humanity continues to face new and complex
challenges. The continuation of armed conflicts,
hunger, poverty, massive human rights violations, the
spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, the scar
of terrorism and the risk that non-State actors can
acquire, develop and use weapons of mass destruction
indeed constitute a threat to international peace and
security. Therefore, the international community has
every reason to act collectively to reform and
strengthen the United Nations in order to render it
better prepared to address the many and complex
challenges we are facing.
The Republic of Angola follows with great
concern the developments in several areas of the world,
particularly on the African continent. In spite of a
relatively positive tendency characterized by a
decrease in areas of tension in the world today, it is
necessary to continue to pay special attention to the
peace processes in various parts of the world,
particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Côte d’Ivoire, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau, to mention
only a few.
Regarding Guinea-Bissau, my delegation is
satisfied with the results achieved, and we commend
the political maturity shown by the people of Guinea-
Bissau during the transition period, particularly the
civic responsibility demonstrated during the period of
presidential elections.
In this context, we believe that respect for the
constitutionally established institutions of sovereignty
is an indispensable condition for political stability.
Only this will create a propitious environment for the
accomplishment of tasks that guarantee the
maintenance of peace and economic reconstruction.
Such is the expectation of the Guinean people, who
went to voting stations in such significant numbers.
That is a vote for democracy.
In that connection, we welcome the round table
on Guinea-Bissau, scheduled for the month of
November, and we urge donors to respond positively
since the international community’s assistance remains
a fundamental condition for the process under way.
Regarding the process of consolidation of peace
currently in progress in the Great Lakes region,
Angola, in its capacity as a core country, is pleased
with what has been achieved so far. We thank the
Group of Friends, and particularly the Government of
35

Canada, for the support they have been providing, and
especially for the second Great Lakes Conference, due
to be held next November in Nairobi.
Although we understand that the primary
responsibility to prevent and resolve conflicts in Africa
falls upon African States themselves, we share the
notion that the international community should, in
partnership with regional and subregional
organizations, play a more significant role in the
prevention and resolution of conflicts on the continent.
Based on our own experience, we believe that in
order for strategies for the prevention and resolution of
conflicts to be successful, they should be based on an
approach that is as inclusive as possible. In this
connection, the cooperation of the key organs of the
United Nations — the General Assembly, the Security
Council and the Economic and Social Council — is
absolutely essential. The pertinent involvement of the
international financial institutions, as well as the
private and business sectors, has proven to be equally
fundamental.
For this reason, we support and welcome the
decision of the High-level Meeting to create the
Peacebuilding Commission. We are ready to work with
partners towards rendering this organ operational as
soon as possible.
Angola supports the creation of the permanent
fund for the consolidation of peace. We are also of the
view that activities related to disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration should be financed
from the regular budget and attributed to peacekeeping
operations.
While the illicit exploitation of natural resources
was not mentioned in the outcome document of the
summit, we hope that during the current session of the
General Assembly this issue will be given due
consideration since it constitutes a fundamental
element for the strategy of prevention and resolution of
conflicts.
Terrorism undoubtedly constitutes a permanent
threat to the world that no country can face alone.
Therefore, it calls for cooperation among all countries,
with the United Nations playing the central role in the
fight against it. In this connection, we join the
Secretary-General’s plea for the conclusion, as urgently
as possible, of the comprehensive convention against
international terrorism, which would contain a
universally accepted definition of the concept of
terrorism.
Five years since the adoption of the Millennium
Declaration, the social and economic situation in
several parts of the globe continues to be characterized
by extreme poverty.
As well-articulated mentioned by the Secretary-
General in his report, “In larger freedom” (A/59/2005),
poverty is not only about development; it is also a
matter of security and respect for human rights, which
are fundamental to the Millennium Development
Goals. For this reason, I agree with several previous
speakers that this issue in the outcome document ought
to be dealt with in greater detail. Thus, we look
forward to continuing our work in the relevant forums,
in particular in a strengthened Economic and Social
Council.
The fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria,
tuberculosis and other illnesses constitutes an
indispensable condition for peace, stability and
international collective security. For this reason, we
urge the international community to redouble its efforts
in mobilizing the required resources for the prevention
and treatment of these illnesses.
Let me take this opportunity to express my
Government’s appreciation to the United States for
funding and initiating a programme to fight malaria in
Angola, as well as in Tanzania and Uganda.
In my delegation’s opinion, in order to meet the
challenges facing the world, it is imperative that we
proceed to the reform of the main organs of the United
Nations, with a view to adapting them to the current
reality. We will remain active in the process of reform
of the United Nations, including the Security Council
and the other primary bodies of our Organization.
We share the opinion that the composition of the
Security Council should properly reflect the present
day political reality. Enlarging the Security Council
would render it more transparent and more
representative, with greater credibility and, in
particular, greater authority in its decisions.
Nevertheless, we would like to underline that the
enlargement of the Council is just one aspect of the
reform that needs to be completed. We should not
underestimate other elements of Council reform that
we consider no less important, such as the need to
36

improve and render more transparent its working
methods.
I am convinced that the results reached at the
High-level Plenary Meeting during this session of the
General Assembly will stimulate the continuation of
the debate on the process of the reform itself. This will
create a platform that will reinforce the Organization’s
common vision and objectives: strengthening
cooperation and providing greater assurances that
international peace and stability can only be found in a
reinforced multilateralism."
AGO,1998,"Allow me to
begin by congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti, on behalf of
the Government of the Republic of Angola, on his
election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the
General Assembly. We are convinced that his experience,
wisdom and diplomatic skills will help us to achieve the
goals we set for this new session.
Angola is especially pleased by the election of a
representative from Uruguay, a country that has greatly
contributed to the preservation of peace and security in
the world, as was recently demonstrated by its
participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operation
in Angola.
I should like to pay tribute to the outgoing President
for the manner in which he conducted the work of this
important body during his mandate. And a word of
appreciation goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi
Annan, for his dynamism and for the wisdom he has
demonstrated at the helm of our Organization.
Almost 10 years have passed since the end of the
East-West confrontation. We had hoped that by this time
there would have been a greater positive impact on the
international scene, especially regarding peace and
security, and economic development.
Unfortunately, in spite of the progress we have
made — particularly in the promotion of democratic
values and in the greater respect for human rights, among
others — we are still witnessing the proliferation of
internal armed conflicts, violent border disputes among
nations, military aggression against independent and
sovereign States, continued degradation of the
environment, and economic decline with the consequent
social and economic deterioration, especially in
developing countries. We are also witnessing an increase
10


in transnational organized crime and terrorism, which poses
a serious threat to the stability of all nations.
This scenario casts a shadow over the prospects for
the rapid implementation of the new political world order
that emerged as a result of the end of the cold war, which
would bring peace, stability, development and democracy.
We still have a long way to go.
It is incumbent on the United Nations, given its
universal character and singular role in international
relations, to shoulder the main responsibility in the search
for solutions to all the problems that have become obstacles
to achieving peaceful development and the well-being of
our peoples, and in devising fair and effective formulas that
meet the collective interests of its Members.
The question of conflict resolution and prevention
should be given high priority, for this will ensure the
alleviation of tension in the world. The urgent creation of
early-warning mechanisms will certainly enable the
international community to act in a timely manner to
prevent the triggering of potential conflicts, thus avoiding
the repetition of past mistakes, such as those we have seen
recently in Africa.
In this connection, Angola shares the views of the
Secretary-General as expressed in the recommendations in
his report (A/52/871) on the prevention of conflict and the
promotion of sustainable development in Africa, and hopes
that the members of the Security Council will turn them
into practical action.
United Nations international arms control efforts
should not be restricted to weapons of mass destruction. We
must urgently focus on the issue of small arms and other
war matériel sold to terrorist groups by some producer
countries. These supplies have led to an increase in armed
actions by subversive groups and are an incentive to all
those who wish to take power by force. We believe that the
creation of special mechanisms for the control of small-
arms exports to armed groups, as well as the imposition of
restrictive measures against those States that violate them,
could help to stop the proliferation of weapons around the
world.
The United Nations, in cooperation with regional and
subregional organizations, should promote the creation of
collective defence and security mechanisms as a means to
prevent the threat of conflict and guarantee the territorial
integrity, independence and sovereignty of States.
The United Nations will not be able to face many of
its challenges unless it can count on the commitment and
engagement of its Member States. This is especially true
with respect to the resolution of its financial crisis and the
reform of its structures to conform to the new
international reality. We feel encouraged by the reforms
undertaken by the Secretary-General aimed at turning the
Organization into a more dynamic and effective body.
The reform process must be thorough and include the
United Nations main bodies, especially the Security
Council. The Council’s current structure is outdated.
Angola supports eliminating the current geographical
imbalance in the composition of the Security Council by
increasing the number of both permanent and non-
permanent members to ensure that the main regions of the
world are fairly represented.
The claim of the African continent to at least two
permanent seats should be adequately addressed, not only
because the region is not currently represented at all, but
also because it is the largest regional group in the United
Nations. Angola also supports the Brazilian claim to a
permanent seat given the exceptional role the country has
played in United Nations activities in all areas, and
especially because it belongs to a region that has no
permanent members in the Security Council.
The Republic of Angola is facing a difficult and
critical phase in its history. We cannot yet announce the
end of the war and the beginning of a new era of
consolidation of democracy in Angola. The peace process
and all related efforts made by both the Angolan
Government and the international community are blocked
due to UNITA’s deliberate, systematic non-compliance
with the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, the pertinent
Security Council resolutions and Angolan law. Mr. Jonas
Savimbi has demonstrated his unwillingness to transform
UNITA into a civilian political party.
As Members are aware, the Lusaka Protocol, signed
by the Government and UNITA in 1994, should have led
to the end of the internal conflict, which was resumed by
UNITA after its defeat in the 1992 general elections. But,
four years since the agreement came into force the peace
process has yet to be concluded, and, what is even more
dangerous, it has suffered serious setbacks due to the
successive obstacles raised by UNITA’s militarist wing,
led by Mr. Savimbi. UNITA deliberately deceived the
United Nations and the international community when it
declared that it was totally demilitarized. As the Security
Council itself could determine, UNITA continues to
11


maintain active military units with sophisticated weaponry.
UNITA has also hindered the process of normalization
of State administration by refusing to abandon the areas it
illegally occupies. At the same time, it has initiated a new
escalation of hostilities throughout the country, unleashing
armed attacks against local government authorities, the
national police and the national armed forces, while also
engaging in massacres of the civilian population. Hundreds
of people have been killed, mostly civilians; about a million
have been displaced; and UNITA has reoccupied areas
where State administration had already been normalized.
The United Nations Blue Helmet units and humanitarian
convoys have also been targets of UNITA’s military
actions, which constitute crimes against humanity, given
their nature and characteristics as well as the coldness and
cruelty with which they are committed. They are terrorist
crimes as defined by international human rights and
humanitarian law instruments. The international community
cannot passively watch these systematic abuses, which flout
international legal and moral values.
During the recent summit in Durban, South Africa, the
heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned
Movement condemned Jonas Savimbi for these systematic
human rights abuses. Similarly, the heads of State or
Government of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) — well aware of the seriousness of
the Angolan situation, which has had terrible repercussions
for the whole region — held Mr. Savimbi solely
responsible for the current stalemate in the application of
the Lusaka Protocol. Due to Mr. Savimbi’s staunch pursuit
of war as the only means to attain political power, he is
continuing to reinforce his military wing’s capabilities. This
behaviour was declared by SADC to be that of a war
criminal. As has been done in some other regions of the
world, Mr. Savimbi and perhaps his closest collaborators —
who together are responsible for all the war crimes
committed in Angola — should be made to respond in
court for the heinous crimes they have committed over
many years.
Throughout the peace process, Jonas Savimbi’s stance
has revealed a personal strategy aimed at creating
generalized chaos in the country in order to take power by
force. The facts are clear: it does not make sense for
UNITA to resort to armed struggle against a State where
political activity is not restricted and where UNITA
participates in its main political institutions — namely, the
Government and Parliament. Furthermore, Angola’s armed
forces include hundreds of UNITA members, including
generals.
It is unacceptable to have a political organization
such as UNITA, which is not even subject to international
law, challenging each and everyone, including the
Security Council by blatantly and systematically violating
its resolutions. UNITA itself is being penalized because
of one man, Mr. Savimbi, who abuses the good faith of
his countrymen who believed in UNITA as a credible
political alternative in the emerging political system of the
fledgling Angolan democracy.
For all those reasons, the Security Council in
resolution 1127 (1997) tried to separate the wheat from
the chaff. In the course of imposing new sanctions against
UNITA, the Council issued a list of UNITA members
universally considered dangerous elements. This list is
headed by Mr. Savimbi, who is thereby forbidden to
freely circulate in the world. Only a criminal would
receive such a sanction from the international community.
Along those lines, the Angolan Government has
suspended UNITA members from participation in the
Government. The Government demanded a clarification
of their position vis-à-vis the peace process in Angola:
either they are in favour of peace and democracy, or, like
their leader, they choose war as a means to take political
power. All those who chose peace have since resumed the
activities for which they had been appointed within the
framework of the Government of Unity and National
Reconciliation. Recently, political leaders and party
cadres, together with officers from UNITA, made it clear
that they did not support war as does Mr. Jonas Savimbi.
On 2 August, they issued a political manifesto
denouncing Mr. Savimbi’s behaviour and, in an effort to
revitalize UNITA, they created a Renovation Committee
which removed Mr. Savimbi from the leadership of the
party. The goals defended by the UNITA Renovation
Committee in its political manifesto are those of peace
and the consolidation of democracy. This renovation
movement supports the peace accords, national
reconciliation and the effective transformation of UNITA
into a civilian political party, and it has given a new
breath of hope for the conclusion of the peace process.
For that reason, the Angolan Government has
decided to recognize UNITA’s Renovation Committee as
its only interlocutor and partner in the implementation of
outstanding tasks in the Lusaka Protocol. The SADC
countries have already recognized the Renovation
Committee, and we are convinced that the international
community at large will not hesitate to support and
promote the efforts of the new UNITA leadership as it
12


assumes its role in the young, multi-party democracy in
Angola.
The Government of Angola does not believe it is
either prudent or realistic, but rather, dangerous, to yet
again give Mr. Savimbi the benefit of the doubt. This
would only lead to more false expectations, and we would
be wasting much valuable time to take appropriate
measures in this respect.
In the light of the new situation in UNITA, the
Angolan Government feels optimistic and therefore is still
committed to the successful conclusion of the Lusaka
Protocol. It will, however, continue to take all necessary
measures against those who pursue attempts to disrupt the
political order, so as to guarantee the territorial integrity of
the country and the protection of its citizens.
From this rostrum we want to draw the attention of
countries, such as the Togolese Republic and Burkina Faso
to the fact that the Government of Angola will not continue
to tolerate the support they are providing to UNITA’s
militarist wing led by Mr. Savimbi. This includes facilities
for military training for these groups to commit terrorist
acts in Angola. This is a clear violation of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) Charter, the United Nations charter
and Security Council resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997)
and 1173 (1998).
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my
Government’s heartfelt tribute to the efforts and role of the
United Nations in the peace process in Angola, and
especially the contribution of the late Matre Blondin Beye,
former Special Representative of the Secretary-General, in
support of peace in Angola.
I would also like to reiterate my Government’s appeal
to the international community to continue to render
humanitarian assistance to the displaced people in Angola
and to assist in the rehabilitation of social and economic
infrastructures.
Angola is also concerned about events in other areas
around the world. In the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, the military invasion by foreign forces is a serious
threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that
country. This could also destabilize the central and southern
regions of the continent. This led some countries, including
Angola, to consent to the request for military aid by the
Congolese authorities within the framework of the SADC
Organ on Politics, Defence and Security.
The recent summit in Victoria Falls of the leaders of
the countries involved in the problem is a step in the right
direction for the resolution of the crisis. Angola supports
the withdrawal of the invading troops and the drafting of
an agreement that ensures respect by all countries in the
region of the independence, territorial integrity and
sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
This would enable that country’s authorities to begin the
task of establishing a broad internal dialogue that should
lead to general elections in 1999, in accordance with the
democratization programme established by President
Kabila.
Angola welcomes the reinstatement of the
legitimately elected authorities in Sierra Leone and the
initiation of the process of the return of the refugees.
Angola hopes this is the beginning of the normalization
of the situation in that country.
In Guinea-Bissau, the signing of a ceasefire
agreement between the Government and the junta opens
broad opportunities for a negotiated end to the conflict.
We salute and encourage the efforts being developed by
the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries
(CPLP), where Angola, along with the countries of the
region, will continue to contribute to their efforts to foster
reconciliation between brothers and sisters in Guinea-
Bissau.
In Western Sahara, the obstacles placed in the path
of a peaceful solution have been progressively removed.
Angola continues to believe that a referendum held on the
basis of fairness and justice is the best means for the
people in the territory to choose their own destiny. We
support the continuation of United Nations and OAU joint
efforts.
We would also like to call the attention of the
international community to the problem of Somalia.
Although we recognize that the parties to the conflict
have the primary responsibility for finding a peaceful
solution, we believe this will be possible only with the
support of the United Nations.
We regret the lack of significant progress in the
Middle East peace process. Angola encourages the parties
to comply with the commitments made under the Oslo
agreement. We continue to defend the right of the
Palestinian people to self-determination, and we advocate
a rapid and fair resolution of the issues of the occupied
Arab territories, including Palestine, which should take
into account the interests of all the peoples in the region.
13


We believe that this will ease the tensions in Arab-Israeli
relations.
The situation in East Timor, a territory with which
Angola shares linguistic links and a common anti-colonial
struggle, has recently seen positive developments as a result
of the understanding reached between Indonesia and
Portugal, under the auspices of the United Nations on the
reduction of the Indonesian military presence in the
territory, will contribute to the achievement of a peaceful
solution. Angola reaffirms its support for the struggle of the
people of East Timor for their right to self-determination.
The current world economic situation raises serious
concerns, since it contributes directly to the deterioration of
the standards of living of millions of human beings,
especially those in developing countries. We are concerned
by the imposition of unilateral restrictions to free trade and
financial and economic cooperation, such as the embargo
imposed against Cuba. Its victims are the most vulnerable
groups in society: women and children. The extraterritorial
nature of these measures runs counter to international law
and does not contribute to forging links of friendship
among peoples.
We believe that we urgently need to promote
international economic cooperation based on a partnership
that will allow all those that participate in the process to
share equitably in its gains. In spite of the implementation
of endless reforms and structural adjustment programmes,
as recommended by the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank, the economies of developing countries
continue to make such modest advances that we must
question the real objectives of such reforms.
We join with those who have spoken before us in
reiterating our need to consider establishing a new
international economic order that is more real, more fair
and more equitable, capable of strengthening the
international financial system and supporting national
efforts to promote economic development throughout the
world.
It is not enough to appeal to the understanding of the
developed countries. We need to be more strongly involved
in the transformation of the international economic picture.
The application of measures that would have an immediate
impact, accompanied by well-structured programmes, such
as the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for
Africa, deserve special attention if they are to attain the
success we expect of them.
The Final Declaration of the twelfth summit of non-
aligned countries, recently held in Durban, South Africa,
also defines some steps that can be taken to solve the
crisis, among which it underscores an increase in South-
South cooperation.
This year, we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
This occasion should be an incentive to develop effective
instruments to promote and protect all human rights and
fundamental freedoms, since non-respect of these rights
is the main cause of conflict and instability. The
establishment of the International Criminal Court will be
a significant step in this direction. The Angolan
Government is sparing no effort to promote, protect and
defend all human rights. Were it not for the bellicose
behaviour of Mr. Savimbi, Angola would have hosted,
late this year, the first ministerial conference of the
Organization of African Unity on human and peoples’
rights in Africa. That initiative was my Government’s
contribution to the jubilee of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
In conclusion, let me emphasize the role the United
Nations is playing to promote and protect human rights
throughout the world.








"
AGO,1981,"Mr. President, your election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly represents recognition of your unquestioned qualities as a veteran diplomat and just recognition of the constructive role played by the country that you represent in such a dignified manner, Iraq, on the international scene. On behalf of the People's Republic of Angola, we are extremely pleased to express our heartfelt congratulations and our sincere wishes for success in the discharge of your mandate.
251.	I should like to take this opportunity to extend to Mr. Rudiger von Wechmar our sincere gratitude for his tireless work during the period in which he presided over the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly and for the dignified and enlightened manner in which he discharged his high responsibilities.
252.	I should also like to pay tribute to the Secretary General for his considerable and significant efforts in the search for solutions to the thorny problems which the international community faces.
253.	It is with profound concern that we address the Assembly inasmuch as the international situation has worsened considerably to the very point of threatening the actual survival of humanity. The present crisis in the process of achieving detente has created a new danger for international peace and stability.
254.	Despite the praiseworthy and persistent efforts of the socialist countries and of the democratic and peace loving and just ice-loving forces throughout the world to achieve detente, general and complete disarmament and the worldwide prohibition of the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, notably nuclear and bacteriological weapons, including the neutron bomb, not only have conflicts between States and plots against the sovereignty and security of States increased, but also the arms race has proceeded even further in the escalation of the irrational. Moreover, the cold war has once again reappeared by virtue of the disastrous policies pursued by the present Administration in the United States, which is bent upon direct or indirect confrontation between East and West.
255.	Thus, forces hostile to the emancipation of peoples continue to attack the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries as well as the right of peoples under foreign domination to self-determination and independence. More and more they have resorted to the use of force, military intervention, occupation and interference, in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Thus, hotbeds of tension persist, above all in the Middle East, Africa particularly in its southern part—SouthWest and SouthEast Asia, the Caribbean and Central America. New conflicts between States have been further exacerbating the international situation. .
256.	A year ago [7th meeting], we drew the attention of the Assembly to the progressive deterioration of the international situation. It is regrettable to note that its causes have persisted and their effects have been aggravated by the policies of certain .Western Powers: the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the policy of nonalignment have npt been strictly respected; aggression of all kinds against independent States has been fomented and encouraged; military bases have been imposed or strengthened in all parts of the world; the serious moves repeatedly made by the socialist countries and progressive and democratic forces aimed at achieving detente, general and complete disarmament and a comprehensive ban on the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction have been blocked; the arms race has been deliberately and dangerously encouraged; the efforts of the developing countries aimed at a gradual reduction of the existing and ever-growing gap between the rich and poor countries have been impeded; resolutions clearly setting forth the imperative need to make the Indian Ocean a real zone of peace have not been respected; and the legitimate right to independence of the Namibian, South African, Sahraoui, Palestinian, East Timorean, Chilean, Salvadorian and Puerto Rican peoples, as well as many others, have been thwarted.
257.	In this alarming situation which clearly threatens the future of peoples, especially that of the peoples of the developing countries, and the growing tragedy of human beings subjected to exploitation, oppression and injustice, we are compelled to repeat our earlier words:
""It is time for the millions of human beings still without freedom or the right to choose their own future to be able to avail themselves of ways and means of fighting servitude, humiliation, tyranny, poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease.
""It is time for all developing peoples to take resolute action in the fight against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, Zionism, expansionism, apartheid and the exploitation of man by man so as to be able freely to choose their own economic, political, social and cultural systems free from intimidation or pressure. It is time for them to take into their own hands their own natural resources and to exploit them for their own benefit and not for the benefit of multinational corporations. It is time for them flatly to reject all forms of subordination and dependence on any Power and all interference and all pressure, be it political, economic or military. It is time for them to demand, in combined and concerted fashion, the dismantling of foreign military bases on the territories"" of their countries which have been established against their will. It is time for them to make an effective contribution to the safeguarding of international peace and security and the easing of international tension. It is time for them to make a further effort to find effective means of mobilizing their human, financial, organizational and technological resources, thus laying a solid foundation for mutual economic cooperation [in a wide variety of fields]"".
To achieve that, perhaps all that is necessary
""is for all the nonaligned countries without exception decisively to put into effect the final Declaration and the Program of Action for economic cooperation approved at the historic Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries, held at Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979, for the serious problems besetting the world today to be properly resolved. That is our hope and our conviction"".18
258.	Directly faced with the provocations, acts of aggression and challenges of the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime, the People's Republic of Angola expects from the international community further commitment and decisions commensurate with the requirements of the moment, so that the Angolan people can, for its part, make greater efforts to expel the racist invaders, to retaliate against future acts of aggression and to ensure the defense of its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the crucial situation facing southern Africa, any passiveness, any abdication of duty on the part of the international community would be a reward for illegality, a substantial encouragement for criminal acts of aggression and even a contribution to the consolidation of the minority racist and terrorist Pretoria regime.
259.	No one here is unaware of the magnitude or the intent of the recent armed invasion perpetrated by the Pretoria regime against the People's Republic of Angola, or the enormous sacrifices already made by the people of Angola and the extremely high price it is paying, virtually alone, in thousands of human lives and in material damage, in the accomplishment of its internationalist duty and in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of international bodies concerning the independence of Namibia.
260.	At that time, the head of State and Government of Angola took care to bring to the attention of the competent international bodies and forums the facts of the brutal aggression and its disastrous consequences. He requested the. convening of an emergency meeting of the Security Council so that the Council could take effective measures commensurate with the situation, once it had recognized a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola and a grave threat to international peace and security.
261.	Despite the condemnations of the South African invasion made in firm and unequivocal terms by nearly the whole of the international community, the Government of the United States of America unscrupulously resorted to the use of the veto to oppose the adoption of a Security Council resolution that would have condemned the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime. That was clear proof of its close alliance with the shameful system of apartheid, and undeniable testimony to its denial of human rights and its insolent scorn for the African community in particular.
262.	Ever since the establishment of the United Nations Council for Namibia in May of 1967 as the legal Administering Authority of Namibia until independence and the decision-making body of the United Nations for that Territory, the Pretoria regime and its allies have endeavored to thwart the discharge of the mandate of that Council and have orchestrated a series of maneuvers aimed at impeding or delaying as long as possible the inevitable independence of the Namibian people and, notably, the coming to power of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the sole legitimate representative of the people of Namibia.
263.	In Security Council resolutions 428 (1978), 447 (1979), 454 (1979) and 475 (1980) on the numerous premeditated, persistent and prolonged armed invasions perpetrated by South Africa, in flagrant violation of the airspace, national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola, the Security Council, among other things, in condemning South Africa's aggression against the People's Republic of Angola,
""... demands that South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola"" [resolution 428 (1978), para. 4]',
""Demands that South Africa cease immediately its provocative armed invasions against the People's Republic of Angola ..."" [resolution 447 (1979), para. 3];
""Requests Member States urgently to extend all necessary assistance to the People's Republic of Angola and other frontline States ..."" [ibid., para. 5];
""Calls for the payment by South Africa of full and adequate compensation to the People's Republic of Angola for the damage to life and property resulting from these acts of aggression"" [resolution 475 (1980), para. 6];
""Decides to meet again in the event of further acts of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola by the South African racist regime, in order to consider the adoption of more effective measures in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, including Chapter VII thereof' [ibid., para. 7],
264.	As can be seen, the Security Council decided on numerous occasions to envisage the adoption of more effective measures against the Pretoria regime. And we have been awaiting those measures patiently to this day.
265.	Thus, faced with the intransigence of the Pretoria regime in regard to putting an end to its illegal occupation of Namibia, faced with its refusal to observe the relevant resolutions of competent international bodies, faced with the continued criminal aggression perpetrated against the People's Republic of Angola and other front-line States, which undeniably represents a serious threat to international peace and security, a particularly serious question arises: how many new acts of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola, how many invasions or acts of premeditated armed aggression, how much loss of human life and how much more material damage must we suffer before the competent international bodies adopt the really effective measures that are available to them?
266.	Everybody knows that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations plan elaborated and negotiated by the Western Powers within the contact group are being challenged by the present North American Administration, concerned as it is with providing protection to the apartheid regime and the latter's illegal interests in Namibia.
267.	The contact group having expressed in Rome its ""belief that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provided a solid basis for the achievement of a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question, Africa is waiting for the foreign ministers of the member nations of that group to establish, at their forthcoming meeting to be held on 24 September here in New York, the modalities and the timetable for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), without amendment of any kind, so that Namibia may become independent during 1982.
268.	In South Africa itself, the situation continues to deteriorate progressively, to the extent that the internal contradictions of the apartheid regime have been aggravated and the heroic fighters of the African National Congress [ANC] tirelessly pursue their political and military activities, the effects of which have been recognized by the Pretoria regime and by the South African press. Our tributes and confirmation of our steadfast solidarity go to the ANC militants.
269.	In Western Sahara, the heroic Sahraoui people, led by the POLISARIO Front 20 its sole legitimate representative, is victoriously continuing its armed struggle against Moroccan occupation to recover its independence and its national sovereignty. It is with new, justified hope that we are awaiting the necessary political solution in the wake of the recent deliberations of the Implementation Committee on Western Sahara of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], which met from 24 to 26 August at Nairobi. We hope that the decision of that Committee to organize and conduct a general and free referendum on self-determination may become a reality as soon as possible, once a ceasefire has been established between the parties to the conflict, namely, the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco, and once the withdrawal of the Moroccan forces has been assured.
270.	As regards the development of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, we reaffirm that the specific proposals contained in the declarations of its Government since 15 May 1980 constitute a valid basis for the search for a negotiated political solution. What is essential is that the neighboring countries, that is, Pakistan and Iran, heed these words, in line with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, because that would result in the normalization of relations among three neighboring nonaligned countries and would favor the restoration of a climate of harmony and stability in the region.
271.	For its part, the valiant people of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has won appreciable success since last year in consolidation of its revolutionary process and in gaining control of its territory, as well as in the economic and social fields. It is, however, regrettable and inconceivable that the legitimate representatives of the people of Kampuchea still do not occupy their rightful place in all international bodies.
272.	Despite the persistent efforts of the heroic people of Korea to reunify its country peacefully and without any foreign interference in its internal affairs, we note with indignation the continued imperialist* maneuvers aimed at establishing two Koreas. It is imperative that there be an unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in the southern part of Korea, that the armistice agreement be replaced by a lasting peace agreement and that existing military bases there be dismantled, in order that the people of Korea in its entirety may make a reality of the three principles that are essential to its future: independence, peaceful reunification and national unity.
273.	As regards the situation that prevails in East Timor, it is deplorable and unacceptable that foreign armed forces belonging to a member nation of the nonaligned movement should have occupied a part of the Territory namely, the capital of the Democratic Republic of East Timor ever since the proclamation of its independence in 1975, following the withdrawal of the former administering Power without its having defined or established the legal and political status of the Territory.
274.	Last year the Portuguese Government decided to re-assume its obligations and responsibilities with regard to East Timor, and it formally reaffirmed the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination. We permit ourselves to hope that the Portuguese Government will effectively, with firmness and courage, make every effort to end the Indonesian military occupation and ensure the transfer of power to the people of the Democratic Republic of East Timor, in so far as it bears responsibility for finding a solution to this problem.
275.	In this context, we appeal to the international community to note the verdict of the Permanent People's Tribunal on East Timor, which met in Lisbon from 19 to 21 June 1981. The verdict has been circulated as document A/36/448. That verdict clearly shows that the Indonesian Government has been guilty of the crime of war and genocide in East Timor and that the Government of the United States is guilty of complicity in the aggression.
276.	It is incumbent upon the international community to render all possible assistance to the people of East Timor.
277.	In the Middle East the problem remains the same, although its consequences are becoming even graver for the Arab peoples. As long as the legitimate right of the Arab people of Palestine to recover their homeland, usurped by Israel, and to establish an independent State is not fully recognized by all, as long as Israel does not withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories, as long as it does not stop its criminal raids and aggression against Lebanon, as long as it continues its policy of establishing settlements in Palestinian or occupied Arab territory, as long as the United States of America does not stop supporting Israel in all possible ways in its plans for annexation, as long as Jerusalem is not fully restored to the Arab nation and as long as the so-called Camp David agreements and the EgyptianIsraeli peace treaty represent a partial and separate commitment which does not take into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, thus constituting a gross violation of resolutions adopted by numerous international bodies, a just and lasting peace will never be achieved. However, we are convinced that the solution of the Palestinian problem and of the Middle East situation is in the hands of the Arab countries if they decide, together, to use all the means available to them against all those that support Israel.
278.	We reaffirm our steadfast support for the Palestinian people and their sole legitimate representative, the PLQ.
279.	We also take this occasion to reaffirm our tireless support for the people and Government of the Republic of Cyprus in their just struggle to protect their independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non alignment.
280.	In Latin America appreciable and positive changes have taken place thanks to the courageous struggle waged by the peoples there. We commend the victories won by the people of El Salvador and their front-line organizations, the Frente Democratico Revolucionario and the Fuerzas Populares de Liberación Nacional Farabundo Marti', in their legitimate struggle against the present regime, as well as the successes achieved by the Puerto Rican and Chilean peoples in their struggle against imperialism and its agents to bring about a transfer of power to them and so that they may freely decide their own future.
281.	It is with particular satisfaction that we welcome the Republic of Vanuatu on its becoming a Member of the United Nations. We also welcome the proclamation of independence of Belize, which we hope soon to see a Member of the United Nations.
282.	The people of Angola will soon commemorate the sixth anniversary of the proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola. Under the enlightened leadership of Comrade Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, President of the MPLA—the Labor Party—President of the Republic and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, the Angolan people are fully mobilized to expel the armed forces of Pretoria from the southern part of the national territory and thereby to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic and to devote the necessary means to its economic and social development.
283.	We wish to express our deep gratitude to all those who, in one way or another, have shown their solidarity with us following the criminal invasion carried out by the racist and terrorist Pretoria regime. We hope that the People's Republic of Angola will be able to benefit from the urgent provision of material and financial assistance so that it may overcome the present grave situation and ensure our national reconstruction. The struggle goes on. Victory is certain.
