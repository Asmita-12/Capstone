MCO,2014,"The lofty aspirations of the Millennium Development Goals 
guided our first steps into the era of the second 
millennium and enabled us to realize, in part, the 
priorities that we hold so dear. With this shared 
experience, which is extraordinary in terms of what it 
has made concrete, and aware of the new challenges 
that have been imposed on us over the past 15 years, 
we now have clear lessons on which to build the future 
we want. We now know that peace and development are 
inseparable.

The future to which we all aspire can be understood 
on three levels, based on the three pillars of sustainable 
development that command our attention equally. The 
work we have started on defining the post-2015 era, 
by its very nature and given the challenges it poses, 
merits committed efforts by the entire international 
community, which have already been undertaken. 
Indeed, it requires a contribution by all States and all 
parts of society, including the private sector, academia, 
philanthropy and, obviously, non-governmental 
organizations. It also must be, as a matter of ethics but 
also to ensure its viability, inclusive, participatory and 
based on good governance.

Those are therefore the bases for defining the post-
2015 era, despite the glaring paradoxes and the many 
obstacles we unfortunately face. At a time when the 
world is highly interdependent, its communications 
technology performing as never before and its riches 
abundant, inequalities continue to grow, and too many 
of us remain marginalized and live in unacceptable 
conditions.

Inevitable climate change, which is recognized as 
the greatest challenge of our time, will decide the fate of 
our planet and darkens our future prospects by already 
threatening our present. Conflicts persist, while others 
are born, and terrorist acts lead to a range of problems 
that challenge traditional defence strategies. This past 
year, existing and new conflicts have escalated towards 
an unacceptable level. The Monegasque authorities can 
only reiterate their commitment to the values of the 
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United 
Nations and join the efforts of those who seek a peaceful 
and political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine.

The use of chemical weapons in Syria and the assault 
on civilian targets in Syria, Iraq, the Gaza Strip, South 
Sudan, Mali, the Central African Republic and Nigeria 
have spread horror and are barbarous practices. They 
are intolerable. That is why the Government of Monaco 
condemned acts of abject violence by supporting the 
adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) last 
week, which establishes a new legislative and policy 
framework to coordinate international efforts to fight 
against the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters.

The Principality shares the grief of the French, 
British and American peoples following the heinous 
killings of their nationals who were held hostage. In 
memory of those victims, His Serene Highness Prince 
Albert II asked that flags at administrative buildings and 
Monegasque public institutions be flown at half-mast. 
Those who commit such heinous crimes in the name 
of a religion they blaspheme annihilate the foundation 
of our society by violating the rule of law and respect 
for the standards that we have developed together. They 
use communications networks and social networks, 
which we might think would be used to spread harmony 
and unity, to spread hatred and chaos. We have reason 
to wonder about their motivations and the reasons that 
make their appeal so convincing.

The response is obviously rooted in exclusion and 
the marginalization of people who have not yet benefited 
from what we call progress. It often involves young 
people without prospects for the future. Therefore, 
it is our responsibility to design inclusive social 
integration policies, promoting education and youth 
employment. Young people have never formed such a 
large proportion of the world population — particularly 
in developing countries. They must be an integral part 

of the decision-making process in order to allow them 
to realize their human potential.

We welcome, in that respect, the “Rights Up 
Front” initiative of the Secretary-General, launched in 
November 2013, whose primary objective is to make 
sure that human rights violations do not become mass 
crimes and to enable the Organization to act more 
quickly by placing people at the heart of its strategies 
and operational activities.

On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the 2005 
Summit, and especially as memories of sinister 
genocides come to mind, we must do a better job of 
promoting the responsibility to protect. That is the 
primary responsibility of every State, as we know, but 
we also need to be able to help States for which capacity-
building is difficult. Prevention remains a fundamental 
aspect of our Organization’s work. In that regard, the 
involvement of regional and subregional organizations 
is essential to the effective implementation of the 
protection of populations from genocide, war crimes 
and crimes against humanity. The promotion and 
protection of human rights must be at the heart of our 
policies. Prince Al-Hussein has our full confidence. 
With his experience and his unwavering commitment 
to peace and the rule of law, he can be the right United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for our 
times.

Another aspect also deserves emphasis — the 
delivery of humanitarian assistance in conflict zones. 
It must not depend on the political context. The 
politicization of humanitarian assistance should be 
a priority item for discussion at the global summit in 
2016.

In the light of the increasing number and persistence 
of crisis areas, caused both by conflicts and by natural 
disasters, whose frequency we now associate with the 
rate of climate change, we must take into consideration 
the needs of over 50 million people. The magnitude of 
those needs justifies the new partnerships that have 
been formed around organizations, local partners and 
the private sector and individuals.

The unprecedented threat of the Ebola virus in West 
Africa is testing our ability to respond in an effective 
and coordinated manner. We support the establishment 
by the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
Mission for Ebola Emergency Response to counter the 
large-scale threat Ebola poses to international peace 
and security. In that regard, I wish to acknowledge the 
commitment of the Principality of Monaco, which is 
effectively contributing to that unprecedented struggle, 
together with the World Health Organization and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross. We share in 
the grief of the victims and that of their families. We 
are aware that the families’ tragedies are compounded 
and their pain is made unbearable by the fact that they 
are unable to take care of their loved ones or provide 
proper funerals for those who die.

In these difficult times, we need to establish a new 
post-2015 sustainable development paradigm. Universal, 
inclusive, ambitious and concrete, it must accommodate 
the pressures of a growing global population and the 
urbanization that comes with it. It requires us to adapt 
our methods of production, consumption and transport 
and to opt for clean technologies. We need to define the 
nature of the world we want to live in, with and for our 
children. As I mentioned earlier, it is vital that the needs 
of the most vulnerable be duly taken into consideration 
and that economic independence for women and young 
people be ensured. It is time for women to realize the 
transformation that the Secretary-General announced 
by breaking through the glass ceiling that for too long 
has kept them from achieving their potential. Without 
the full contribution of those who constitute 50 per cent 
of humankind, sustainable development will not be 
achieved.

The year 2015 will also mark the fifteenth 
anniversary of the adoption of Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000), on women, peace and security. 
We reiterate our call to end impunity for crimes related 
to sexual and gender-based violence against women, as 
well as all the abuse women suffer.

The undeniable success of the Climate Summit should 
be measured not only by the commitments announced, 
but also by the broad participation of the private sector, 
foundations and civil society and by the sense of 
ownership expressed by all the stakeholders concerned. 
The Summit therefore succeeded in catalysing society 
as a whole, thus ensuring that the political momentum 
will be maintained in Lima and Paris. As the issue of 
climate change cannot be separated from the question 
of the oceans, the Prince’s Government will continue 
to defend an objective of sustainable development 
dedicated to healthy and productive oceans for all. The 
Assembly may rest assured that Monaco will engage in 
discussions, which will begin in January, and we will 
continue, in both national and international policies, to 
act as a responsible and unifying partner.
"
MCO,2001,"﻿In taking the floor here at the
Headquarters of our Organization — recipient of the
2001 Nobel Peace Prize — meeting in New York,
which has been so tragically attacked, I wish naturally,
at the outset, to renew to the delegation of the United
States and the great country it represents, our friend,
and the American people the expression of heartfelt
sympathy of the Principality of Monaco. Confronted
with insane actions that prompt horror and indignation,
we find ourselves in natural solidarity in this ordeal, as
well as in the task that now faces the international
community of making decisions and working so that
our States and societies will be spared other appalling
violent acts in the future.
I would like once again to extend to you, Mr.
President, and to all the members of the Bureau our
sincere congratulations on your election to the
presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I
am confident that, under your great leadership, our
work will be carried out in a way that will best meet
the expectations of the international community. I also
wish to assure you of the spirit of cooperation of the
delegation of Monaco.
I also wish to hail the brilliant re-election of the
Secretary-General, a clear sign of the confidence that
we have in his intelligence and humanity, which are
linked to his profound knowledge of the circumstances
in which he must discharge his noble mission regarding
world affairs, of which our Organization is seized. We
also wish to assure him of the great satisfaction that the
Principality of Monaco, my country, shares at the
11

renewal of his mandate and of our full support, which
we will continue to offer him.
We are very gratified that the 2001 Nobel Peace
Prize was awarded to him jointly with our
Organization, a fully deserved and justified reward that
should motivate us — the States Members of the
United Nations — to work together even more with
him to champion peace and to fight the many seeds of
conflict that threaten our world, terrorism, human
rights violations, underdevelopment and pandemics
such as AIDS.
The tragic circumstances in which this session of
the General Assembly is taking place make it our duty
to contribute with even greater determination than in
the past to the struggle against terrorism. Owing to
their enormity and to the defiance that is behind them,
its manifestations can, as we have seen, pose a grave
threat to international peace and security. The
Principality of Monaco firmly supports everything the
Organization has adopted and implemented to stifle
this scourge, which can be so devastating to the
principles we all hold. The fact that what a lawyer
would call “edged weapons” were enough to bring
down one of the most modern and sophisticated
symbols of human creativity reminds us of the fragility
of our societies, which densely populated urban centres
and interdependence in all vital areas make even more
vulnerable in the light of the boundless contempt of
some for human life and human dignity.
Among the most important of the commitments
our States have undertaken on behalf of their peoples
by signing the Charter of the United Nations are the
obligations to maintain international peace and
security, to develop friendly relations among nations
and to encourage respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms: commitments that a handful of
terrorists, in their blind facelessness, rejected with
appalling arrogance and savage brutality.
Two months to the day have elapsed since that
tragic event. Although emotions have by no means
subsided, the healing effects of time are beginning to
give us a little of the sense of distance that is so
necessary for more objective consideration of this
astonishing political challenge and this unacceptable
human tragedy.
The General Assembly very quickly undertook
such consideration through its debate in early October
on measures to eliminate international terrorism. For
its part, the Security Council had already correctly
marked out the initial path and the principal guidelines.
And the Secretary-General has repeatedly called on
Member States to remain more united than ever, and it
appears that his words have been heeded.
Although the nature of terrorism did not change
on 11 September, its scale did. The General Assembly
decided to respond with a complete cohesiveness that
has been rare in its history. By adopting its resolution
1373 (2001), the Security Council did not shrink from
drawing on the full scope and range of its powers under
Chapter VII of the Charter; it took note of the existence
of a threat to peace and an act of aggression and thus
decided on the exceptional measures that the
Principality of Monaco is proud to be implementing.
For us, following up on these initiatives with the
necessary effectiveness means not only implementing
the resolutions that reflect our common determination
and our commitment to fight terrorism and formulating
additional agreements and conventions, but also, first
and foremost, bringing our expertise to the
implementation of instruments that have already been
concluded and to which we have acceded or intend to
accede. Improving the Organization’s action in the
legal sphere is both indispensable and of top priority;
we know this, as does the Government of the
Principality. Therefore, yesterday I signed and
deposited, on behalf of my father, the sovereign Prince,
the instruments of ratification of the International
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism. The Principality of Monaco considers it
essential that there be coordinated worldwide action
against all forms of financing of terrorism, in order to
deprive extremist movements of the resources that
enable them to do such serious harm to the
international community and to its deep-seated
aspirations to peace and security. Afghanistan, much of
whose territory is occupied and a portion of whose
people are today enslaved, is the most telling example
of this.
The visionary Millennium Declaration and the
outcomes of recent world conferences — such as the
United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small
Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the
Durban World Conference Against Racism, Racial
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related
Intolerance — also merit special attention. Without
question, these latter can contribute greatly to
improving, respectively, international security and
12

understanding among peoples. On the fight against
racism, the subject of the Durban World Conference, I
would note that the Government of the Principality of
Monaco has decided to recognize the competence of
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination, established under the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination, to receive and process communications
from individuals or groups of persons charging
violations of a right set out in that instrument, to which
Monaco is a party.
International economic and financial cooperation,
with its inevitable human and social consequences,
must also be included in the reflection prompted by
these events, which is more necessary than ever in the
light of the issues facing us today. Because it is in
part the result of the new interdependence, the
globalization of trade in products, manufactured goods
and services — disparaged by some and hailed by
others — must also be a part of our urgent intellectual
and practical endeavours, so that beyond the
constraints and imperatives that guide it, human beings
can regain their just, legitimate role. Above all, the
economy must serve today’s men and women, with
respect for their legitimate aspirations, their vital needs
and the age-old richness of their diversity.
Regional and subregional cooperation is
particularly conducive to such a goal. My country is
convinced of that; in the Mediterranean area we are
engaged in the trade, culture and technological spheres,
and are working to promote sustainable development
and environmental protection. Nor should we neglect
activities which by their nature tend to bring together
men and women from different backgrounds, such as
artistic and cultural events, academic meetings and
sporting competitions. In the Assembly’s debate on the
agenda item entitled “Building a peaceful and better
world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, the
delegation of Monaco will recall the irreplaceable role
in that connection of physical education and sport, as
well as of the Olympic games.
Another way to bring human communities
together is the multilingualism for which the United
Nations must be a model. That key item is on the
Assembly’s agenda this year. The Principality of
Monaco will state its views on that subject and will
stress the remarkable and unquestionable advantages of
multilingualism for genuine understanding and mutual
respect among peoples.
Alongside modern science and technology, which
are moving forward and rapidly becoming universal,
thus fostering exchanges among peoples, more
traditional forms of communication also have an
important role to play. In our view, teaching and
information, more than ever before, have a
fundamental role in spreading ideas of peace and
understanding among men and women in our troubled
times. Here, the General Conference of the United
Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific
Organization has given us excellent regulatory texts,
working documents and programmes that we must
revitalize with increased energy in order to provide
greater hope to young people, who are often frustrated
by the harshness of daily life.
We also, and very often, give thought to the seas
and the oceans, which made such a contribution in
ancient times to meetings of civilizations and to the
spread of knowledge, thus enriching art and culture
while developing trade and solidarity. A few days from
now, the delegation of Monaco will state its views
during the consideration of the agenda item on oceans
and the law of the sea. My country has always been
devoted to better scientific knowledge and careful
protection of the marine environment, an indispensable
source for the harmonious flourishing of life.
Thus the Principality of Monaco, with other
Member States, requests the Assembly to grant
observer status to the International Hydrographic
Organization, for which it is the headquarters, in order
to allow that institution to strengthen its cooperation
with Governments and to advance international
initiatives and exchanges in marine cartography —
initiatives and exchanges designed to spread
knowledge of seabeds and coastal zones, as well as to
make navigation easier and safer.
Respect for the decisions and resolutions taken by
our forums and the strengthening of our regulatory
actions, as well as the implementation of the
declarations and plans of action of our recent global
conferences, are significant commitments to which the
authorities of the Government of the Principality of
Monaco are dedicated. In our difficult times, they
represent shared values which prompt us to act together
in the interest of our international community, which is
also in the interest of each of our countries.
To close on an optimistic note, allow me to
express the hope — a hope that I believe is shared by
13

many here — that the wisdom of nations united more
than ever before will be able to triumph rapidly over
the evil represented by terrorism in its new global and
universal form, while extirpating from the world the
stubborn roots that fuel it.





"
MCO,1993,"For me this is a very special occasion, for it is the
first time I address, on behalf of my father, the Sovereign
Prince of Monaco, and on behalf of my country, this
prestigious world Assembly of the States Members of the
United Nations.
I wish to tell members of the tremendous joy of all
Monégasques and inhabitants of the Principality of Monaco
when my country joined this great world Organization. I
should like to take the opportunity once again to thank the
members of the Security Council and of the General
Assembly for their favourable consideration of Monaco’s
application for membership of the Organization.
I wish the Assembly every success in its work. A
number of its agenda items are of particularly vital historic
and political significance. The decisions we take will
undoubtedly have far-reaching and long-term consequences
for the future of the world community.
I wish also, to congratulate you, Sir, very sincerely and
warmly on your election to the presidency of the General
Assembly. My congratulations also go to the members of
the General Committee. I have no doubt that your skill and
lengthy experience will enable our work to proceed under
the best possible conditions.
Like all countries that put their trust in international law
and cooperation, the Principality of Monaco, in its relations
with other countries, has always relied on respect for
international norms and documents.
Its Princes have always been fully aware of the fact that
the maintenance of peace necessarily entails respect for the
sovereignty of States and the development of friendly
relations among peoples.
Prince Albert I of Monaco, when he created the Peace
Institute at the end of the last century, was even then
inspired by that philosophy, which led to the founding, in
1919, of the League of Nations and, in 1945, of the United
Nations. On 5 February 1934 Prince Albert’s successor -
Prince Louis II, who was profoundly touched by the
hardship and suffering caused by the First World War - set
up the Medical-Legal Commission of Monaco, whose sober
reflection and work which continue today, gave inspiration
to the drawing up of the 1949 Geneva Conventions of the
International Red Cross.
My country’s commitment to peace is therefore a
tradition of more than 100 years - a tradition observed by its
Princes, whose dynasty will shortly celebrate its 700th
anniversary. It is also a political aspiration that has only
grown in strength with the passage of time. It will always
be adhered to with both conviction and determination in the
General Assembly of the United Nations.
In this spirit, I should like to refer in particular to a
resolution of the International Olympic Committee, of which
I am a member, which unanimously recommends observance
of a long-standing tradition of the Olympic movement - the
principle of the Olympic truce.
The Government of Monaco supports this initiative,
which was signed and endorsed by the National Committees
of 184 countries and was officially addressed to our
Secretary-General on 9 February this year. An international
year of sport and the Olympic spirit would undoubtedly
afford an opportunity to launch this project.
Perhaps it is by constantly repeating certain initiatives
of this nature - albeit modest ones - that we shall be able
gradually to create the just and lasting peace to which we all
so deeply aspire.
Did we not, a few days ago, receive from the southern
shores of the Mediterranean news giving us immense hope
of peace? Though it may be tenuous, we are at one with
those who inspired it and with those who are today
endeavouring to make it a success. It is our earnest wish
that they will succeed.
Peace is not just the silence of guns. Indeed, there can
be no doubt that the establishment of genuine peace can flow
only from greater respect for justice, human rights and
fundamental freedoms. For this very reason, the work and
the conclusions of the Vienna Conference on human rights
warrants our very close scrutiny.
Finally, echoing a wish expressed by my father,
Prince Rainier III, when he addressed the Earth Summit in
Rio de Janeiro, I should like to emphasize that the
Government of Monaco has set for itself the priority of
protecting our environment, both natural and cultural, so that
it may provide a healthy, enriching and balanced life for all.
The Principality has undertaken major efforts to combat, in
particular, all types of pollution that attack and contaminate
the Mediterranean.
My country is more than ever resolved to encourage all
initiatives in this area, including the establishment, on its
own soil, of institutions dealing with coordination and the
10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
adoption of a General Assembly resolution that would
proclaim 1998 the international year of the seas and oceans.
I should like, in conclusion, to reiterate that the
Principality of Monaco - in full respect for the rule of law
in domestic affairs and for treaties and law in the
international order; having neither armed forces nor military
arsenals; and bearing no enmity to anyone at all - is fully
prepared to assist the Organization in all its actions,
undertaken sometimes with great difficulty, aimed at
maintaining and rebuilding peace.
"
MCO,2002,"﻿First of all I wish to thank the President of the
fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, His
Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for the masterful way
in which he accomplished his work. I would also like
to thank the members of his Bureau. Significant
progress was made during the session we recently
finished. One item in particular concerns us as it
involves the conduct and revitalization of our
proceedings.
Secondly, I would like to take this opportunity to
welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to
appoint, as of 12 September 2002, Mr. Sergio Vieira de
Mello to succeed Her Excellency Mrs. Mary Robinson
as United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights. My Government has always appreciated Mrs.
Robinson's wholehearted commitment and knows it
can count on Mr. Vieira de Mello, who has many times
shown his competence and his dedication to the
Organization, to show just as much commitment in
promoting and protecting human rights.
I am very pleased at the outset of the fifty-
seventh session of the General Assembly to
congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the
presidency both on my own account and on behalf of
the highest authorities of my country, as well as to
congratulate all the members of the Bureau. I pledge
the full support and cooperation of the delegation of
Monaco to help them complete their important work.
One year ago, an attack, as vile as it was
cowardly, struck the United States of America. That
day its instigators and perpetrators placed themselves
not only outside of the law, but outside humanity,
outside of the universal fundamental values and
principles that inspire our nations and guide the ethical,
political, economic and social progress of States. That
wanton act provoked an unprecedented reaction from
the international community. It unanimously gave the
members of the Security Council and the General
Assembly sophisticated means to fight terrorism in all
its forms, including by cutting off its financial
resources.
The Principality of Monaco participated in this
fight with determination in response to requests by the
Security Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee.
In broadening information exchange with other States,
both bilaterally and multilaterally, we established or
strengthened monitoring and surveillance measures
which were necessary in the of legislative, regulatory,
and judicial spheres.
On 10 November 2001 I personally signed the
International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism, which entered into force in
Monaco on 8 April 2002, and our Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, on instructions
from my father, the Sovereign Prince, signed on 24
June 2002 Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing of
Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components
and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.
The Principality of Monaco, in fact, is or will be
a party to all major universal and regional instruments
designed to strengthen cooperation among nations to
fight against terrorism. This has greatly enhanced our
cooperation with other States.
In that regard I must make reference to a law
which was adopted unanimously last June by our
National Council, the parliament of Monaco, and
which entered into force on 8 August 2002. This law
amends, strengthens and supplements the existing law
on the involvement of financial entities in the fight
against money-laundering and financing terrorism. The
text takes into account Monaco's undertakings as a
United Nations Member State as well as measures
anticipated by competent bodies such as the Financial
Action Task Force.
Also on 8 August 2002, the authorities of my
country were happy to have implemented the Council
of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure
and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, even
though the Principality of Monaco, while fervently
hoping to be so, is not yet a member of that noble
European institution. I also wish to note the speed and
relevance of my country's response, especially since
8

our country is sometimes subjected to unjustified and
incorrect criticism in this area.
While terrorist threats persist and while civilian
populations continue, unfortunately, to be subjected to
the yoke of terror, the origin and form of this plague
seem now to be better understood and under greater
control. Measures, both national and international,
have been implemented with the help of the Security
Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)
and seem to be yielding encouraging results. The
strengthening and broadening of the mandate of the
Terrorism Prevention Branch, as the Secretary-General
has proposed in the report requested by our Assembly,
seems to meet all of the conditions we need to upgrade
the fight against terrorism, not only by allowing us to
bolster cooperation among United Nations Member
States, but also by providing enhanced technical
assistance to countries that ask for it.
Thanks to a prompt and effective international
reaction, Afghanistan, for too long a home to terrorists,
has regained its freedom. Its new provisional
Government, which emerged from the traditional
assembly, the Loya Jerga, last June, has endeavoured,
particularly with the help of our Organization, to
rebuild the country and to establish a democratic
political regime. We wish it full success.
Another area of satisfaction on the part of the
international community is the nuclear disarmament
agreement that was adopted last May by the two great
Powers, the United States of America and the Russian
Federation. Other events in the world are also hopeful.
The Republic of Sierra Leone and the Republic of
Angola are taking steps towards recovery in a peaceful
and democratic spirit. Encouraging signs of hope are
seen everywhere. In Africa, we again fervently hope
for the success of the peace initiatives in Burundi and
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A
calming of the situation in the Sudan is also of great
interest to us.
The Organization of African Unity (OAU), which
became the African Union last July, has played an
invaluable role in reinforcing harmony between
African peoples. We are following this undertaking
with intense interest, as it took on a new dimension this
year. We take this opportunity to address to His
Excellency, Mr. Amara Essy, Interim Chairperson of
the Commission of the African Union, our sincere
congratulations and encouragements.
In Latin America, we see with hope that some
countries, whose economic and financial conditions
were once in bad shape, are in the process of recovery,
thanks in particular to the help of international
financial institutions.
In Asia, finally, the prudence shown by the
leaders of India and Pakistan over the border disputes
has led to the reduction of tension in Kashmir. We are
sincerely grateful for this. This is an excellent step,
similarly to the one taken by Sri Lanka, which has
renewed the dialogue with the Tamil separatists so as to
put an end to too much suffering.
Another source of satisfaction is Timor-Leste,
which with the effective and valuable help of our
Organization was able to successfully achieve
independence and acquire political and financial
structures that are crucial to its development. We are
therefore happy to welcome very soon, the Democratic
Republic of Timor-Leste to the United Nations. We are
also quite happy to welcome the admission of the
Swiss Confederation as a Member State.
Switzerland has always been, particularly since
the creation of the League of Nations in Geneva, a
steadfast participant in the international promotion of
peace, human rights and humanitarian protection. Our
congratulations and wishes for success and prosperity
are formulated to those two States, to their leaders and
to their people.
The United Nations needs them more than ever
now, and also needs all the good will and talent
possible to meet the high ambitions that we set for
ourselves when the Organization was created,
ambitions renewed firmly and solemnly at the
Millennium Summit, as well as during the large
international meetings that followed.
My country is committed to implementing the
action plans adopted during those exceptional
meetings. Our special session on children and the
second World Assembly on Ageing have tangibly
changed the perception that the international
community had of children and seniors. Both must
become actors who are more integrated and active
within our societies.
While deciding to increase its voluntary
contributions to the large programmes of the United
Nations aimed at development and the protection of the
environment, the Government of Monaco has at the
9

same time decided to concentrate its efforts on specific
areas and specific regions. The Mediterranean region is
an example of our fight against marine pollution that
aims to save regional flora and fauna. My Government,
whether through its Office for International
Cooperation for Development and the Environment, or
through non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
which are numerous and active in Monaco, is
encouraging the implementation of specific projects,
projects that are essentially ecological in nature,
depending often on the availability of micro-credits.
As regards the Mediterranean Sea, next 10
December we will be celebrating the twentieth
anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). It was indeed on 10
December 1982 that that text was open for ratification
by States at Montego Bay in Jamaica. It was the result
of almost 15 years of negotiations, which we will
solemnly celebrate on this coming occasion.
There are particularly difficult times, such as the
present moment, when the status quo is not good
enough, times when we must show determination in
order to bring innovative ideas to meet the fundamental
changes going on throughout the world. The Secretary-
General, whose dynamic nature and wisdom we
appreciate, mentions this in his report on the follow-up
to the major conferences organized by the United
Nations at different summits, including the Millennium
Summit. The report is important and timely.
The substantive session of the Economic and
Social Council in July also confirmed the need for such
steps. The Ministerial Declaration, adopted on that
occasion, focuses usefully on the importance of
developing human resources, protecting health, and
providing education, particularly for young girls, and
focuses on their contributions to development.
 I would like to commend the President and the
Bureau of the Council. His Excellency Mr. Ivan
Simonović, its President and the Permanent
Representative of Croatia, and the other Members of
the Bureau have all toiled with competence and great
skill in order to guarantee the success of the Council's
work.
During the high-level debates, some trends
emerged that our Government believes are essential.
For example, there is the choice of a governance that
allows us to establish true partnerships that depend
mostly on the human resources of developing countries
themselves, as well as on businesses and civil society.
Yesterday's high-level plenary meeting of the
General Assembly produced solemn and excellent
results and enabled us to gain a better understanding of
the character and the imperatives of the New
Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), which
undoubtedly offers real prospects for mobilizing
resources for Africa and integrating it into the world
economy. The establishment by the Economic and
Social Council of an ad hoc advisory group for African
countries emerging from conflict is a step that we are
also following. Without political stability, there can be
no guaranteed sustainable development.
The concept of a culture of protection' advanced
by the Secretary-General, with regard to special
economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and help in
natural disasters, provides the advantage of associating
in a single thrust preventive action and priority
assistance to the communities affected. We appreciate
the principle and the scope of this activity.
In the aftermath of conflicts and crises, the link
between humanitarian action and long-term
developments is crucial for the success of any national
reconstruction programme. Public meetings of the
Security Council dedicated to such matters provide an
opportunity to emphasize, with the necessary impact,
the importance of such measures.
The World Summit on Sustainable Development
(WSSD), which has just finished in Johannesburg and
in which I participated, reminded us of the essential
concerns for the future. The Monterrey consensus was
confirmed, stressing the fact that there can now be no
stable and balanced development without serious
interdisciplinary thought and innovative ideas based on
a genuine will to protect our environment and to
respect the natural resources of our planet, including
sea resources and non-renewable natural resources, by
ensuring that we share them fairly and reasonably.
The Summit confirmed and strengthened the
principles proclaimed 10 years ago during the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development,
held at Rio.
I will not reiterate my country's positions and
initiatives on these questions, as I discussed them at
length at Johannesburg. I should like to reaffirm,
however, that the Government of the Principality of
10

Monaco is determined to respect the commitments it
undertook on that occasion.
The international community must continue to
work tirelessly in the combat against AIDS and in the
fight against many endemic diseases, which, in some
parts of the world, are major obstacles to development
and progress. In response to the appeal launched by our
Secretary-General, my Government has decided this
year and for the next two years to make a substantial
exceptional contribution to the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS.
If we want globalization, in particular economic
globalization, to be of benefit to all, it will have to be
rooted to a greater extent  and we all are aware of
this  in a type of development that ignores neither
the basic needs of human beings nor the values of
justice, morality and equity, to which we all attach
particular value.
In speaking of the fundamental principle of
justice and of the moral values which have inspired our
Organization so profoundly, I should like to reiterate
how warmly we welcomed the recent entry into force
of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court. The first Assembly of States Parties to the Rome
Statute has just been held, under the eminent
presidency of His Royal Highness Prince Zeid Ra'ad
Zeid Al-Hussein, Permanent Representative of the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Decisive and specific
steps were taken on that occasion.
I should like to close by appealing to the peoples
of Israel and Palestine to put an end to the violence and
to overcome their rancour and resentments. A shared
heritage and the belief in a future of coexistence
represent the underpinnings of a dialogue leading to
peace.



"
MCO,2013,"Twenty years ago 
I took the floor for the first time before the General 
Assembly. A few months before that, on 28 May 1993, 
Monaco had become the one hundred and eighty-third 
State Member of the United Nations, the smallest 
Member State of the only universal Organization. The 
decision of Prince Rainier III, my father, reflected 
the will to fully assume our role as a responsible and 
committed State within a changing world, where new 
opportunities and new challenges were becoming 
interdependent and transcending borders. 

That vision remains unchanged over the passage 
of time. My country continues to shoulder all its 
responsibilities on the major issues that bring us 
together here today. Faithful to its principles and to 
its past, the Principality of Monaco wishes to make 
its contribution in the most effective way possible to 
the task of building peace, to which we have been so 
attached over the centuries. 

Therefore, inspired by a conviction that our shared 
humanity requires that each of us treat our fellow 
human beings with respect and dignity, tolerance 
and comprehension, we have endorsed the values and 
principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which 
we aspire together to defend and to promote. That 
important decision to fulfil the responsibility that each 
Member State has is strengthened by the conviction, 
originating from the holding of the first Earth Summit, 
in 1992, that sustainable development, without which 
we cannot aspire to our ideal of peace, must be planned 
with respect for the environment of our planet. 

It is in a sombre international context that we are 
going to define the post-2015 development agenda, 
an agenda that will be the cornerstone of the work of 
the Organization and will be crucial to establishing 
its political legitimacy for decades to come. The 
growing insecurity in the world, characterized by the 
fragmentation of societies, threatens the progress made 
in many fields and causes multidimensional regional 
instability that is likely to further deepen existing 
differences. 

The recent attacks perpetrated in Kenya, Pakistan 
and Iraq are another shocking illustration of that 
problem. They remind us that many parts of the world 
are still subject to deadly terrorist attacks. Allow me 
to extend to the families of the victims and to their 
Government my deepest condolences. 

I must also speak out against persisting conflicts, 
which hamper development and cause an unacceptable 
humanitarian situation. With regard to Syria in 
particular, the number of displaced civilians and 
refugees in bordering countries is of great concern. A 
new threshold was crossed with the use of chemical 
weapons, an extremely serious violation of international 
law that cannot be tolerated. Monaco associates itself 
with those who continue to advocate for a political 
settlement of the conflict, especially in the light of 
the recent agreement on the control and destruction 
of chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria. Those 
responsible for the use of chemical weapons cannot go 
unpunished. 

The International Committee of the Red Cross, 
which I wish to pay tribute to for its determination to 
fulfil its mandate in spite of difficult circumstances, 
must be given access to populations in need and must 
be assured that it is able to conduct its activities in full 
security.

The tenth anniversary of the attack on United 
Nations staff in Baghdad is a sad reminder that we 
need to relentlessly continue with our efforts on 
behalf of United Nations staff, who too often have 
become deliberate targets. That deplorable situation 
will be given attention in the coming world summit 
on humanitarian aid to be held on the initiative of the 
Secretary-General, which we fully support.

The evolution of factors that lead to humanitarian 
emergencies forces us to examine the ways in which 
the Organization can act in such circumstances, which 
include conflicts, natural disasters, climate change and 



environmental degradation. We must recognize that the 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to 
which I express my deepest gratitude, needs to be given 
the means and the resources required for it to carry out 
the mandate we have given it.

To those who criticize or threaten the progress of 
the United Nations, the results accomplished show that 
our courageous political decisions, in the fields of both 
security and development, are timely and positive. 

Together, in the year 2000, we defined the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which today 
have made it possible for billions of people to live 
better. Those successes are all the more remarkable 
given that progress has been achieved in spite of the 
effects of many crises of a financial, economic, food 
and energy nature, some of whose consequences linger 
and are even worsening. 

Tomorrow, the special event devoted to the 
MDGs will be an opportunity to reiterate our priority 
commitment to eliminating poverty and an opportunity 
for us to redouble efforts to hasten the achievement of 
the Goals. 

The Millennium Development Goals Report 2013 
indicates the areas that require urgent action and the 
significant gaps that exist, not only among countries 
but within their borders. We cannot tolerate the fact that 
there are still people who have been rejected by society, 
people for whom the hope born of a new millennium 
remains a broken promise. It is not acceptable that in 
today’s world human beings still live close to complete 
destitution, where even their basic needs go unmet. 
That is why we applaud the Secretary-General’s efforts 
on behalf of his mobilization campaigns — Education 
First, “Every woman, every child” and Scaling 
Up Nutrition — which push us to shoulder our 
responsibilities towards the world’s most vulnerable.

Education, the promotion of women, the protection 
of children, public health and the conservation 
of natural resources are priority elements in the 
international cooperation policies that I have outlined. 
They are structured around the eight MDGs, especially 
maternal and child health, the fight against pandemics 
and neglected diseases and the promotion of food 
security, and in particular they are geared towards the 
least developed countries. It seems to me that a policy 
of international cooperation should respond as much 
as possible to their interests, so that a virtuous circle 
of development can be launched and help build a more 
just, stable and less unequal world.

Important advances have often been accompanied 
or completed by the adoption of measures emerging 
from the Organization’s major conferences and 
summits. By strengthening the treaty regime on human 
rights, disarmament and the fight against terrorism, and 
through the regimes established by the Security Council, 
Member States have endowed themselves with the 
means to reaffirm their faith in multilateralism, which 
is the reason for the Organization’s existence, and in 
the rule of law, which is the foundation of our collective 
action. It is vital that we speed up the implementation 
of the Programme of Action adopted in Istanbul in 2011 
at the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least 
Developed Countries.

The work that lies ahead for the President of the 
General Assembly comes at a turning point in our 
history. Under his leadership, the General Assembly 
must not only speed up the implementation of the MDGs 
but also prepare the post-2015 development agenda and 
define the sustainable development goals in accordance 
with this session’s theme “The post-2015 development 
agenda: setting the stage”.

His valuable experience and unreserved dedication 
to the Organization, and to sustainable development in 
particular, will guide our deliberations. We are grateful 
to have him, a son of Antigua and Barbuda, a small 
island developing State, presiding over the upcoming 
discussions, since we are confident that he is all too 
familiar with the issues at stake.

He should also rest assured that Monaco’s 
representative, in its capacity as Vice-President, is 
ready to support him in his noble task.

Based on lessons learned from the MDGs, together 
we will build an ambitious new development programme 
capable of responding effectively to the demands of our 
new reality. I have climate change in mind in particular. 
Greenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase at the 
global level, despite the fact that we have identified 
climate change as one of the greatest dangers of our 
era. The Secretary-General can count on my country’s 
contribution to the upcoming summit on climate 
change, which he intends to hold next September. His 
willingness to bring together leaders from every sector 



of society — civil society, the private sector, the world 
of business and finance and, above all, young people, 
all of them agents of change — is the only path of hope 
for the radical transformation that is needed. There is 
no alternative to defining a new programme and a new 
paradigm.

At the current rate, if we do not change our 
behaviour, we will need the equivalent of two planet 
Earths to meet the needs of the world’s population, 
which, as we know, will reach 9 billion in 2050 and 
has always been concentrated in urban and coastal 
zones, whose natural resources are particularly 
vulnerable. That simple fact should prompt us to adopt 
sustainable modes of production and consumption, 
in accordance with the decisions taken at the United 
Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. That 
essential change of mindset presupposes that we place 
human beings at the heart of the development issue. It is 
no longer a question of agreeing on development plans 
for agricultural, artisanal and industrial capacities. We 
must consider that it is human societies and individuals 
who deserve all of our attention. We must study 
economic and environmental issues in the light of their 
impact on the lives of people and communities. Taking 
those needs into account means that we must reflect 
further on how to ensure responsible development that 
respects the environment and is truly sustainable.

The Assembly is aware of my personal commitment 
to issues involving the oceans and seas. In accordance 
with the Monaco Message on the acknowledged 
importance of the oceans in “The future we want” 
(resolution 66/288, annex), which was adopted in 
November 2011, I am once again committing to 
promoting the role of the oceans in the definition of 
the post-2015 agenda and to reiterating my support for 
a sustainable development goal focusing on the oceans. 
Climate regulation, food and nutrition security, energy, 
tourism, transport and international trade — all areas 
directly or indirectly affected by the oceans — are 
linked to the three pillars of sustainable development. 
I think it is also essential to reaffirm how fundamental 
the oceans are to the world and how serious are the 
risks presented to them through the excessive human 
activity that contributes to their acidification and the 
acceleration of the drop in the resources they contain.

In that context, I would like to say how crucial I 
believe it is that the international community address the 
status of the high seas without delay, and how urgent it 
is that protected marine areas be established, especially 
in the polar regions. If the viability and sustainable 
management of the oceans are to be achieved, only 
an unswerving political willingness to form strong 
partnerships that unite all the parties concerned will be 
able to combat the effects of the overfishing, pollution 
and acidification of the oceans and restore them to 
health and productivity.

Strengthening cooperation and partnerships, as well 
as deciding on concrete action, are also at the heart of 
the preparations for the third International Conference 
on Small Island Developing States, to which I want to 
give my full support, along with a needed boost in the 
solidarity that is essential to promoting sustainable 
development.

The stakes are clear. Let us, who wish to reaffirm 
the central place that the Organization occupies in 
international governance, give it the means to assure 
that leadership role by being ambitious and resolute 
in our task. Let us remember the words of the novelist 
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: “Being a human being 
means being responsible”.
"
MCO,2007,"Allow me, at 
the outset, to address my warmest congratulations to 
the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-
second session. With that election, which honours your 
country, the Group of Eastern European States and the 
members of this Assembly have unanimously 
recognized, Sir, your eminent competence and your 
perfect knowledge of the Organization. You and the 
other members of the Bureau may be assured of the 
active cooperation of my delegation. 
 You have chosen the theme of climate change for 
this sixty-second session. I would like to thank you for 
that initiative, which has been commended by all. 
 Today, I would like to share my observations on 
this issue as well as my personal commitment in 
service of this cause. Very early on, I learned to 
appreciate nature and to take the necessary measures to 
protect it. From my very earliest years, I was taught to 
share and to give back. Then I wanted to see and learn 
things for myself, and my responsibility today is to 
testify and to act. 
 That is why, in June 2006, I decided to make my 
own contribution, as well as that of the Principality, by 
creating a Foundation. The mission of the Prince 
Albert II Foundation is to identify priority and 
symbolic projects and to accelerate their 
implementation in order to reach concrete results 
throughout the world aimed at a sustainable and 
equitable management of natural resources. 
 The Foundation’s activities are based on three 
strategic principles. The first is to act alongside 
nations, international institutions and opinion leaders 
in order to enhance consciousness of and accelerate 
decisions for sustainable development. I am personally 
committed to leading consciousness-raising missions 
on the ground around the world. I will also stand with 
other heads of States, as I do today, and take part in 
international negotiation meetings regarding the 
environment. 
 The second objective of my Foundation is to 
promote initiatives, activities and corporate actions that 
combine innovation with environmental protection. 
The Foundation in supporting and financing about 
30 projects as of this year. Through its activities, the 
Foundation also wishes to attest to the fact that it is 
possible to engage in sustainable practices and 
behaviour that are respectful of the environment and 
compatible with economic, social and human 
development. 
 Lastly, its third objective is to create the broadest 
possible public understanding of the environmental 
challenges and responsibilities involved in those issues 
via outreach activities. I commit myself to devoting the 
time and energy necessary to the success of those 
actions. 
 All the programmes adopted by the Foundation 
comply with the environmental policy of my country. 
Monaco has long been active in protecting the marine 
environment and in developing scientific research in 
marine biology. The creation a century ago of the 
Oceanographic Museum and the Museum of 
Prehistoric Anthropology by my great-great-
grandfather Albert I, and the more recent creation of an 
underwater reserve by my father, Prince Rainier III, 
bear witness to that policy. The RAMOGE Agreements 
for the control of marine pollution and the Agreement 
on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, the 
Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Area 
reinforced that international engagement. That vocation 
is part of the history of my country. 
 This year, I agreed to sponsor an ambitious 
international initiative launched by the United Nations 
Environment Programme, the objective of which is to 
provide for the planting of at least 1 billion trees 
throughout the world in 2007. Seven months after the 
launch of the operation, that objective was achieved. It 
is an extraordinary sign of hope, and I must commend 
the dynamism of the Programme, whose actions within 
the United Nations are essential for the environment. 
 The time for action is today. We already know 
that the future of humanity is at stake. This is a 
collective responsibility. To tackle this urgent matter, it 
is necessary to raise awareness, mobilize capacities and 
revolutionize our lifestyle. That is how we will forge a 
new relationship to nature. As Yves Coppens, a French 
scientist, stresses: “for millennia, climate has dictated 
man’s behaviour; today, it is man who dictates his 
behaviour on nature”. 
 It is also necessary to commit ourselves to 
promoting a new ethic   that of the right to the 
protection of the environment. What better place is 
there than this prestigious institution to lead the way 
forward? That new ethical dimension can be achieved 
only if built on the sincere commitment of each 
individual. That is why Bill Clinton, in his recent book, 
calls for concrete mobilization. As he says so well, 
“each one of us can give something. There is so much 
to do; it is never too late to start”. Like President 
Clinton, I believe that generosity is at the heart of that 
mobilization. 
 It is thus imperative to transcend our own 
selfishness and inertia, and to learn to develop a 
harmonious relationship between humankind and 
nature. Safeguarding our planet is the challenge of the 
twenty-first century. That challenge requires courage, 
tenacity, commitment and generosity. Above all, let us 
act. Peter Frumhoff, one of the main contributors to the 
report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, declared, following a large-scale study 
undertaken by the Union of Concerned Scientists, that 
“some changes are inevitable, but the worst 
consequences can be avoided if we act quickly”. That 
message was reiterated over and over again yesterday 
during the high-level event on climate change 
convened by the Secretary-General. 
 The European Union has shown the way by 
committing to a 50 per cent reduction of its greenhouse 
gases by 2050. Let us help developing countries by 
finding new financial resources; let us quickly update 
our modes of production and consumption. To meet 
that challenge, we must work together to find solutions 
to existing problems. Individual announcements or 
actions will never solve the problem. The threat is 
global. As the climatologist Edouard Bard has pointed 
out, “global warming concerns our entire ecosystem 
and the consequences of this phenomenon can be done 
only at the global level”. 
 We have long lived in a world fraught with 
threats, but for the first time we are facing a planetary 
threat that threatens humankind itself. The evolution of 
human mindsets and behaviour will inevitably take 
time, but the planet cannot wait. Thus, without further 
delay, we must adopt a culture of responsibility. We 
must meet this historic challenge so that we may 
preserve planet Earth for our children. Let us make the 
choice of hope based on humanistic values, and let us 
not forget the power of courage when it is supported by 
the will to place humankind at the core of our 
priorities. 
 There are also ethical considerations which 
inspire my country’s constant and resolute commitment 
in the fight against terrorism. In no circumstances can 
violence ever be a legitimate means to pursue any 
combat, whatever the cause may be. 
 To consolidate its legal framework in compliance 
with international standards, and according to the 
recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force 
on Money Laundering (FATF), the Principality of 
Monaco took measures identical to the European Union 
directives adopted to fight money laundering and 
terrorism. Without waiting for the new report of the 
Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-
Money Laundering Measures, in this area, my 
Government enacted new laws and regulations on these 
issues. With those tireless efforts, Monaco has been 
publicly recognized for leading the way in this field. I 
will maintain the required vigilance so that our 
legislative framework and our security policy will 
continue to guarantee the reputation of the Principality 
as a safe State. In so doing, I reiterate my unfaltering 
determination to combat the manifestations of 
terrorism regardless of their forms. 
 For my country, sustainable development and the 
fight against poverty go hand in hand, in that we are 
called upon to identify a new manner of growth more 
respectful of the resources of our planet, which, while 
abundant, are not inexhaustible. That is the reason why 
I asked my Government to increase by 30 per cent for 
the year 2008, under the heading of international 
cooperation, the total of the Principality’s voluntary 
contributions to the funds and programmes of the 
United Nations. This significant increase of funding for 
official development assistance is proof my country’s 
determination to eventually reach the target of devoting 
0.7 per cent of gross national income to official 
development assistance. A great deal remains to be 
done in the fields of education, access to health care, 
the fight against pandemics and HIV/AIDS, human 
crises following natural disasters or conflicts and, 
lastly, the fight against poverty. 
 I pay particular attention to the Principality’s 
actions through multilateral and bilateral assistance 
programmes, supplemented by the generous initiatives 
of the charitable organizations in Monaco, which are 
also part of my country’s tradition. 
 Children’s welfare has, for a long time, been a 
priority commitment for the Principality. My sister, 
Her Royal Highness the Princess of Hanover, is 
actively involved with this issue through the World 
Association of Children’s Friends (AMADE 
Mondiale). In December, the General Assembly will 
hold a debate to evaluate progress in the 
implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action 
entitled “A world fit for children” (resolution S-27/2), 
adopted in 2002. Considerable progress has been 
achieved in five years, although there still are too many 
needs to be met. 
 Monaco has also joined the campaign entitled 
“Unite for children. Unite against AIDS,” sponsored by 
UNICEF, the Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health 
Organization. My sister, Princess Stephanie, Special 
Representative of UNAIDS, has committed herself 
wholeheartedly to harnessing the energies of the 
Principality and beyond to advance in the fight against 
this scourge. 
 Reform of the Security Council remains a current 
issue. I reaffirm my country’s support for a process of 
increasing the membership of this Council. In fact, the 
chances of maintaining international peace and security 
will be that much greater if the representation of the 
international community in the Security Council were 
the most equitable possible. 
 I also express the wish that the newly established 
Department of Field Support, working alongside the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, will facilitate 
the actions of United Nations personnel on the ground 
working valiantly to safeguard peace. I congratulate 
the Secretary-General on the efforts he has undertaken 
to these ends. 
 My country became a Member of the United 
Nations 14 years ago. Ever since, the Principality has 
increased its participation on the international scene. 
The Principality has taken pleasure in hosting many 
international meetings and high-level conferences in 
recent years.  
 Accordingly, I am delighted that in February 
2008, the tenth special session of the Governing 
Council of United Nations Environment Programme 
and the Global Ministerial Environment Forum will be 
held in Monaco. On that occasion, I will proudly 
receive ministers of the environment of Member States 
to discuss topics similar to those we are tackling within 
the General Assembly framework and thus to continue 
the debate launched here. In so doing, my country will, 
I hope, contribute once again its part to the 
fundamental debates of our time and will reaffirm its 
will to be at the heart of the genuine struggle. 
"
MCO,1994,"At the outset, I should like to extend my sincere
congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to the
presidency of the forty-ninth session of the General
Assembly, and to the newly elected members of the
Bureau. Your outstanding personal and professional
qualities are, I am sure, a guarantee of the success of our
work.
I also take this occasion to pay a tribute to your
predecessor on the podium, Mr. Samuel Insanally, who,
often in difficult circumstances, fulfilled his mandate
expertly and efficiently. For instance, the opportunity he
gave us freely to express our opinions and ideas on
several important problems of our time, such as that of
development, was a significant initiative that will certainly
5


have a positive impact on all our further thinking and work
on these questions.
I turn now to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, to thank him warmly for his efforts in
undertaking the very complex and sensitive missions
entrusted to him by the General Assembly and the Security
Council over the past months. Given that, in many
respects, the state of the world continues to deteriorate,
these efforts have been all the more worthy. While some
conflicts were born or rekindled, others - often long-
standing, but no less virulent - have become worse or have
expanded. Brutality and violence, sometimes interethnic,
have all too often exploded, and no real means have existed
or been available to redress their effects or the harm they
have caused.
While we have been heartened by certain encouraging
developments in South Africa - which we welcome back to
democratic life - or in the Middle East, many potential
conflicts remain and others have already erupted or are
about to do so. Entire peoples are still under the yoke of
dictatorship. The suffering and barbarity entailed are all the
more vicious and painful because the methods of repression
have kept pace with scientific and technical advances. The
crimes of the highest civilization go hand in hand with the
crimes of the highest barbarity. More than ever before,
women, children, the elderly and the weakest and most
vulnerable are threatened and victimized. When peace
collapses - and the more fragile it is the more violent is its
collapse - war quickly becomes total, and civilian
populations, especially the poorest, are rarely spared.
The international community, pained and
overwhelmed, can only resort, in desperation, to
humanitarian assistance. Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Rwanda are the most striking examples of this. Most often,
this humanitarian assistance comes in response to tragic
situations and complex political circumstances that make it
difficult to deliver and, despite all the haste and the efforts
made, render its benefits uncertain.
Bearing in mind the decisions taken by the Security
Council in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a view
to protecting the civilian populations, and inspired by the
courageous and generous initiative recently undertaken by
France in Rwanda with the support of Africa and the
United Nations, should not the international community
adopt a convention-based instrument that would meet this
challenge? For such challenges could face it again in the
future.
Through such an instrument, States parties would
undertake in advance to authorize in case of a conflict the
establishment of protection and security areas reserved for
defenceless children, women and the elderly. The
boundaries of these zones would, of course, need to be
clearly established, with the agreement of the State or
States concerned. Special access routes to such areas -
neutralized airports, roads and railroads - would be
provided for in this treaty in order to ensure the delivery
of humanitarian assistance. The protection and
functioning of these areas would have to be guaranteed by
unarmed agents, preferably volunteers, under the auspices
and responsibility of the United Nations, and they would
wear white helmets or have some other distinctive
insignia, as has already been suggested.
The Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12
August 1949 - which envisaged cordons sanitaires and
security zones, without however making them mandatory
- could serve as a model to a great extent when we
consider this matter. Does not protection for the most
vulnerable sectors of the non-combatant population -
children, women and the elderly - deserve true
international commitment? It would be particularly
significant and symbolic if, on the occasion of its fiftieth
anniversary, after considering a desirability study drafted
by the Secretary-General, our Organization equipped itself
with such an instrument, open for signature by all States,
providing for the establishment of humanitarian zones in
time of conflict.
In this way, the High Commissioner for Refugees,
the United Nations Children’s Fund and international
charitable institutions such as the International Committee
of the Red Cross or certain non-governmental
organizations recognized for their humanitarian activities
would be in a better position rapidly to provide
protection, relief and assistance to the civilian populations
afflicted by destructive conflicts and deprived of their
most fundamental rights.
While it is more important than ever for our
Organization to secure for itself effective means of
protecting innocent civilian populations, we must none the
less not neglect future generations. By depleting the
natural resources of our Earth and damaging our
environment, often out of simple negligence, we are
jeopardizing the future and the happiness of our children.
The Principality of Monaco is fully aware of this and is
striving to assist to the extent within its power in
6


protecting the environment as well as in combating
pollution in the oceans and seas.
By virtue of its maritime traditions, Monaco has
primarily throughout its history stressed the protection of
the resources of the marine environment. A large number
of initiatives have been taken in this respect on the local,
regional and even international levels. The Principality is
always ready to step up its efforts and to strengthen
international cooperation in these areas.
Indeed, in this respect a cooperative undertaking with
the United Nations has existed since 1961. Pursuant to an
agreement concluded between the International Atomic
Energy Agency and the Government of Monaco, an
international marine radioactivity laboratory has been
operating in the Principality. This laboratory has garnered
important and interesting experience in the realm of the
measurement of levels of radioactivity in the seas and
oceans. With the assistance of the United Nations
Environment Programme, it has developed various methods
of monitoring the marine environment on a worldwide
scale.
The proclamation of 1998 as the International Year of
the Ocean, as proposed by the Economic and Social
Council, would, I am convinced, provide an opportunity to
bolster this international cooperation and to once again take
stock of the marine environment, after the assessment
drawn up in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 at the Earth Summit.
In this spirit, we have paid particular attention to
certain conclusions of the Fourth United Nations
Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory
Fish Stocks whose migrations take place both within and
outside exclusive economic zones, which took place here in
August. The alarm that was sounded as a result in
particular of the report drawn up by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations with respect
to the overexploitation of the seas and oceans cannot leave
us indifferent. The careful husbandry and use of such
precious marine resources and the stepped up struggle to
combat marine pollution should continue to be the subject
of the most energetic and attentive concern on the part of
this Organization.
The agreement recently adopted in the context of the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - and we
very much welcome the felicitous conclusion of that
agreement - demonstrates that with goodwill, the
international community can find the right formulae to
accommodate the interests of all by preserving the general
interest, that is, thinking globally but also acting locally.
Only world cooperation can make it possible to
solve the grave problems associated with safeguarding our
environment and as a result respond to the tremendous
challenges that we face now and will increasingly face in
the future. With future generations in mind, I feel
impelled to speak of the future of our Organization,
which next year will celebrate a landmark event: its
fiftieth anniversary.
Important world conferences - the one on population
and development which has just concluded in Cairo, the
one on social development scheduled for Copenhagen in
March next year, or the Fourth World Conference on
Women, which will take place in September 1995 in
Beijing - have been and will be opportunities to intensify
our thinking and build up our means of intervention in
key areas for the future.
The work in progress to improve the functioning of
the Organization and its structures is encouraging. The
Government of the Principality is following these
developments with interest.
I should be remiss if I concluded my statement
without thanking the members of the Security Council
and the States that have contributed to peace-keeping
operations and without stating that the Principality fully
appreciates the sacrifices made. Men and women serving
the Organization have lost their lives. We salute them
and pay tribute to their memory. We must be watchful -
and this is a major responsibility - in order to ensure
better protection for these soldiers of peace while
remembering their wives, their children and their families.
Our action is and should always be designed first
and foremost to serve mankind, to alleviate its sufferings
and remedy the evils of its plight. Is it not time at last to
say, as André Breton wrote, ""for man to go over to the
side of man, lock, stock and barrel"".
I wish, as I conclude my statement, to express my
fervent and sincere wishes for the success of the work of
this forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.
I venture to hope that thanks to general goodwill and
mutual understanding we may be able to find practical
and effective solutions, in keeping with the spirit and
letter of the Charter of the United Nations, to the key
issues before us for our consideration.
"
MCO,2017,"I would like to begin by telling the President how pleased I am to see him conducting the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We wish him success in the accomplishment of this important and delicate task in the service of the international community. I have an excellent memory of my official visit to Slovakia last May. On that occasion I was able to appreciate his work and to consolidate the good relations between our two States.
“Peace must be our goal and guide”. But “without a healthy environment we cannot end poverty and build prosperity”. Those are the words of the Secretary- General, and current circumstances give those words special resonance. It is clear that the threat of nuclear escalation in Asia has never been greater, and that notion can leave no leader indifferent.
In accordance with its obligations, Monaco complies with the Security Council resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter. Respecting the commitments that apply to each Member State is paramount. We therefore refuse to be powerless witnesses of the indefensible stances that pose a grave danger to all our States. We condemn the irresponsibility of those who expose humankind to an irreversible disaster.
Recognizing the importance of cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, Monaco continues to support collective efforts for the promotion of peace and security. As a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe, Monaco participates actively in the work of those regional institutions. In that connection, the Principality pays particular attention to the work of the Special Monitoring Mission on the crisis in Ukraine and its vicinity.
The Principality of Monaco, with 140 nationalities in its territory, has always been open to dialogue. Our country has been enriched by that diversity, which continues today. We are convinced that our common values — the defence of human rights, of democracy and of the rule of law — are among the ongoing priorities of a modern State concerned with the welfare of its citizens and those who live on its soil. The ideals that unite us allow us to move forward together, as our goals remain unfulfilled.
The fight against impunity is part and parcel of those ideals. Refusing to allow atrocity to dictate the law is a sine qua non condition of assumed sovereignty. The Principality of Monaco is fully committed to respect for justice and peace. That underpins our support for the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism on the most serious crimes committed in Syria. To the best of its ability, Monaco will continue its contribution in terms of the assistance to that country’s long-suffering civilian population in order to enable them to rebuild and imagine a better future.
The situation in Africa, where over 20 million individuals are risk of losing their lives as a result of famine, will have serious consequences. Although drought is an exacerbating factor, it must be recognized that the primary cause for this humanitarian disaster is war. In keeping with our traditions, Monaco expresses solidarity by responding to the call of the United Nations for contributions to the World Food Programme and the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as to Monegasque non-governmental organizations.
Above and beyond those urgent humanitarian actions, Monaco’s cooperation system implements a policy promoting the eradication of poverty and fostering sustainable development to serve the most vulnerable. My country’s new strategic plan for official development assistance will work with public and private partners to respond to the most pressing needs — food security, health, education and job placement — beyond the mere duty to assist.
Good governance, the fight against corruption, and sufficient public resources are not empty words, but rather assets without which no State can meet the basic needs of its population or establish its development policies in a long-lasting manner.
Those crises serve only to further justify the Secretary-General’s advocacy for “protection and respect for human rights and for the creation of decent work opportunities for young people”.
Today, by depositing our instrument of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, I once again wish to associate my country with the efforts of the international community to promote their fundamental freedom and dignity. As Dag Hammarskjöld so aptly observed,
“The United Nations was not created to lead mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell.”
Attacks on innocent civilians affect us all, wherever they are perpetrated. We hope that the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism can bring us together in our determination to annihilate this barbarism.
Climate change is putting humankind in imminent danger. The unprecedented violence of recent extreme weather events serve to prompt us once again to recognize our limitations. Faced with nature unleashed, people will always lose. Hurricanes and typhoons have tragic consequences whether they form in the Atlantic or the North Pacific. The Paris Climate Change Agreement has garnered 195 signatures and 159 States parties. That is the clearest proof of the urgency felt at the global level. Only by promoting global awareness and mobilizing all sectors of our societies can we adapt our economies successfully. Several States, including Monaco, as well as some private companies, have already announced major measures aimed at changing our modes of transport, production and consumption. In general, a change in our lifestyles is more than necessary; it is crucial. The joint UNICEF-World Health Organization report of 12 July on access to water and sanitation reveals glaring inequalities that continue to worsen. Too many people are still marginalized or living in unacceptable conditions.
We must also resolutely persevere in the fight against all forms of serious violence against human dignity. In particular, we must work to improve the status of women as long as the discrimination and violence of which they are victims continues. Monaco welcomes the courageous initiative of the Secretary- General in that regard and yesterday signed the Voluntary Compact between the United Nations and Member States with a view to eliminating exploitation and sexual abuse in peace operations, humanitarian assistance, the promotion and protection of human rights and, more broadly, in the Organization’s contribution to sustainable development. That commitment is a strong message that zero tolerance should become the norm for all States.
I believe it is important today to reflect on the creation of the United Nations, if only to appreciate it more. This exercise in remembering can enable us to put our current difficulties into perspective and convince us — if we needed to be convinced — of the importance of this global Organization. That brings me to express my satisfaction with respect to the vision that the Secretary-General has put forward so that the Organization will be better able to assist its Member States in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We support him in his reform initiatives because we want a modern and efficient Organization where international civil servants, both at Headquarters and in its many fields of operation, are invested in a priority mission for which their work and self-sacrifice are recognized. In that regard, I would like to pay tribute to all those who undertake to fulfil this mission on the ground, sometimes, as we have sadly seen too often this year, by putting their lives at risk. It is up to us, the leaders gathered in this forum, to forge an ambitious consensus and provide realistic mandates and sufficient resources to the Organization.
The first voluntary report from Monaco on its implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was presented at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council in July. Monaco, like every State here today, can now deal with ensuring the effectiveness of its choices with respect to the global goals that we adopted here two years ago. I would like to mention the Assembly’s call to action on 9 June with its adoption of resolution 71/312, which recognized that the ocean is our future. The implementation of SDG 14 on marine life, has special significance, and the success of the Ocean Conference, which focused on it, showed us that the conservation and sustainable development of the oceans and seas and their resources are essential for our survival.
We are fully and forever committed to our planet in general and to the oceans in particular. I firmly believe that our ability to save the ocean from gradual decline will help us save the planet. That is why I welcome the Secretary-General’s visionary decision to appoint a Special Envoy for the Ocean, which highlights the challenges to be met and is greatly needed if we are to streamline our actions. There can be no doubt as to the dedication and unwavering commitment of the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, Mr. Peter Thomson, whom we warmly congratulate both on the work he has accomplished in recent months and on his new responsibilities. We have great hopes for his ability to bring together the United Nations system, civil society, the private sector and academia to ensure that the targets of SDG 14 are met. It is therefore with great pride that the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco and the Prince Albert I Foundation will host him at the Maison des Océans in Paris. In doing so, the Principality is continuing a tradition established by my great-great-grandfather — a prince, oceanographer and passionate scientist — one of whose ambitions was to make science accessible to all and to use new knowledge to improve the well-being of humankind.
A few weeks ago I had the privilege of presenting, on the sidelines of the SDG 14 Conference, the Monaco Explorations initiative. The vessel Yersin’s three-year voyage around the world aims to increase our knowledge through marine biological research in association with local scientists, disseminate the results of our research and promote collective and concerted action in areas such as the creation of protected marine zones, while stimulating innovation.
I would like to conclude by affirming my confidence in science, which enables us to base our decisions on proven and verifiable facts. Whether it reassures us or frightens us, science must spur us to action and thereby to moving forward together towards progress and the hope for a better world."
MCO,2010,"I would 
like to convey to you, Sir, the warmest congratulations 
of the delegation of the Principality of Monaco on your 
election as President of the General Assembly at its 
sixty-fifth session. I would like to reiterate to you that, 
in my capacity as a member of the Bureau, I will spare 
no effort to contribute to the success of your mandate 
in the service of the Member States and the 
Organization. 
 We are preparing to begin our work on an 
optimistic note because of the international 
community’s unfailing recommitment to the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as of 
the belief, reaffirmed in the general debate now 
drawing to a close, that the United Nations is at the 
heart of global governance and remains, despite the 
many difficulties, our best hope for ensuring peace, 
development and justice. 
 Economic growth, which is indispensable to 
development and therefore to peaceful international 
relations, cannot take off in the absence of well-defined 
and fair international rules and without respect for the 
rule of law at the national level. Our Organization has 
contributed tirelessly in recent years to strengthening 
the capacities of Member States to enable them to 
provide their citizens with the institutions necessary for 
them to flourish in their communities. The rule of law 
is also a guarantee that the fight against corruption is 
not just a vain promise, that respect for human rights is 
universal and that justice is independent and impartial. 
 The benefits of economic growth must be shared 
and equitable. They must take into account the needs of 
the most deprived and contribute to social cohesion 
with a view to attaining the MDGs and involving the 
full participation of all partners. 
 That is the thrust of Monaco’s commitment 
within the Global Governance Group — the 3G — 
 
 
5 10-55408 
 
whose members are convinced of the need to involve 
the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the 
work of the Group of 20 (G-20), given relevance of the 
General Assembly agenda to international governance. 
In that regard, I draw attention to the ministerial 
declaration of the Global Governance Group adopted 
on 27 September, with a view to contributing to the 
reflections of the working group on the development of 
the next G-20 summit, in Seoul in November. 
 As His Serene Highness Prince Albert II recalled 
before the Assembly, the Principality is determined to 
act as a responsible partner in solidarity and will 
continue its mobilization efforts, both through its 
official development assistance as well as through the 
provision of emergency assistance to populations 
struck by natural disasters (see A/65/PV.4). 
 At a moment when the presence and activities of 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees are increasingly needed and increasingly 
dangerous, the cause of refugees and displaced persons 
must more than ever be placed in our policies and be 
backed unconditionally by the international 
community. Here we wish to express our recognition of 
the devotion of the thousands of people who labour 
under the banner of the United Nations, at times 
risking their lives, both in humanitarian emergency 
situations and in peacekeeping operations. 
 The role of women in driving development is 
now clear to all. I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-
General and the Deputy Secretary-General for having 
strengthened the role of women within the United 
Nations. Monaco welcomes the appointment of Ms. 
Michelle Bachelet to head up UN Women and assures 
her of our full support. 
 The Principality has also endorsed the conviction 
that investing in the health of women and children is 
indispensable for building societies that are more 
stable, more peaceful and more productive, for 
reducing poverty and for stimulating economic growth. 
In that vein, we support the Global Strategy for 
Women’s and Children’s Health, which represents an 
additional step towards the full empowerment of 
women. 
 As atrocities continue to be perpetrated against 
civilians, especially the cowardly crimes of sexual 
violence, we pay tribute to the courage of Special 
Representative Ms. Margot Wallström and her 
commitment to making the international community 
aware of its responsibility and to ensuring the effective 
implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) as we 
approach the tenth anniversary of its adoption. 
 With your leadership, Mr. President, and our 
common will, the General Assembly has the means to 
demonstrate its central role in the major themes for our 
future at a moment when we are all aware of the 
shameful damage caused to the planet by the 
overexploitation of its wealth and biodiversity. We 
therefore attach the greatest importance to the 
preparation of the Rio+20 Conference and hope that 
the green economy and the opportunities it affords will 
become a major vehicle for sustainable development. 
 You can also count on the support of our 
delegation, Sir, with regard to the upcoming summit on 
non-communicable diseases and the consultative 
process on revision of the statute of the Human Rights 
Council and the Peacebuilding Commission, which 
must take into account the presidential statement 
adopted at the ministerial-level meeting of the Security 
Council on 23 September (S/PRST/2010/18). 
 At the beginning of the twenty-first century, our 
deliberations must contribute to bringing together and 
harmonizing our actions. Only our Organization 
possesses both the means and the legitimacy to 
successfully establish effective global governance, and 
we must all show pragmatism and work in a 
constructive spirit to achieve our goals. 
 The interdependence of the global challenges 
which all of us are facing requires us to define together 
a set of rules aimed at coordinating our policies and 
managing relations between Governments, the private 
sector and civil society. We share your belief,  
Mr. President, that our Organization should be at the 
heart of that new multilateralism, which should be 
founded on integration and solidarity. "
MCO,1997,"﻿It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate you, Sir, on
your outstanding election. Your competence and your vast
experience in multilateral diplomacy, to which you have
devoted a large part of your professional life, together with
your personal qualities assure us that our work will be
conducted properly and be successful.
I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a
well-earned tribute to Ambassador Razali of Malaysia for
the effective way in which he conducted the fifty-first
session of our General Assembly.
I congratulate, also, the members of the Bureau, who
I am convinced stand ready to do their utmost to ensure
the success of this important session.
It is in fact an important session because, upon the
invitation of the Secretary-General, it is being devoted
largely to an exchange of views, which I hope will be
productive, on the reform of the Organization.
The document before us, entitled “Renewing the
United Nations: A Programme for Reform”, is of the
greatest interest to my country's authorities. The desire to
make the Organization, and above all its Secretariat, more
efficient by improving the coherence and coordination of
its activities is the very judicious inspiration for the
proposed reform process. That desire is easy to
understand and endorse, given its obvious responsiveness
to current real needs.
During the 52 years of its existence, the United
Nations has regularly been challenged by the requirements
of an ever changing world and has thus been led to
develop or create new structures — without, however,
always reducing or suppressing old ones.
The current exceptionally broad changes in the
political, economic and social spheres irresistibly call for
a profound transformation of multilateral cooperation.
They require the Organization to make an ineluctable


effort to adapt that cannot be delayed without jeopardizing
its prestige and seeing its international role inexorably
wither. Thus, we can only endorse the will demonstrated by
the General Assembly at the fiftieth anniversary of the
United Nations and the recent initiatives undertaken. In our
view, it is rational to concentrate and better coordinate the
Organization's missions around the five great pillars of its
Charter responsibilities: international peace and security,
development, humanitarian affairs, economic and social
affairs and human rights.
The promotion and protection of human rights, which
the Secretary-General very rightly proposes to strengthen,
receive the intersectoral treatment which their
multidisciplinary nature naturally evokes. That nature must
not allow us to forget, however, that this fundamental area
of the Organization's competence requires the strengthening
of its appropriate structures. The High Commissioner for
Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, who has just assumed
her office — and whose arrival we welcome sincerely and
confidently — must be given sufficient human and financial
resources, as well as the decision-making autonomy,
necessary to fulfil the essential duties that have fallen to
her.
Next year's celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be an
opportunity to recall the commitments undertaken by the
Member States when they adopted that text on 10
December, 1948, and, a few years later, on 16 December
1966, the two international human rights agreements which,
I am pleased to say, the Principality has recently ratified.
The Emergency Relief Coordinator entrusted with
humanitarian assistance must also enjoy the greatest
autonomy and the means necessary to allow him to
intervene effectively and promptly when necessary — a
task that the Government of the Principality accords the
highest priority.
This autonomy must, more generally, touch the entire
international civil services. The independence of United
Nations agents — the Secretary-General first among
them — is the guarantee of the quality of their service and
of the trust which the international community places in
them.
The decision to bring together all the field
programmes and information centres in common premises,
to be known as United Nations Houses, is both rational and
symbolic. It is an ideal response to the current needs to
concentrate and better coordinate operational activities,
while promoting a strong and cohesive image of the entire
system. We strongly encourage the Secretary-General to
pursue this approach, which has recently been undertaken
in South Africa.
For those States that will not have the opportunity to
host such Houses, might we not consider establishing a
United Nations presence in the form of a volunteer
honourary representative: a national figure mandated,
alongside the authorities, to disseminate information and
heighten general awareness? The widespread practice of
appointing honourary consuls could, in this respect, serve
as an example.
The special team dedicated to reorienting
information activities highlights, in the Secretary-
General's report, a need which we understand: to improve
and enlarge the United Nations capacity to communicate
at the country level through innovative local partnerships.
The establishment of honourary United Nations
representatives would be one way to follow up that
suggestion on a practical and affordable level.
As the Secretary-General points out, public interest
in the United Nations could also be sharpened by the
organization of high-level thematic debates within General
Assembly bodies. We agree with this, given that such
debates would receive more attention from the press and
public opinion than those currently held and would lessen
the need for large world conferences.
The Security Council has already taken steps to
improve information services and exchanges with Member
States that are not members of the Council and with the
international community at large. These steps are useful
and welcome and are beginning to bear fruit.
The important question of enlarging the membership
of that principal organ, which depends on a decision from
the Member States, is also of great interest to us. The
High-level Working Group on that subject has worked
tremendously hard under the leadership of successive
Presidents of the General Assembly and the dedication of
its Vice-Presidents. We convey to them our warmest
thanks. The Principality of Monaco is ready to endorse
unreservedly any commitment or solution that might be
achieved, including the creation of long-term seats lasting
six to 10 years, for example.
In tandem with the improvement already begun in
the functioning of the Economic and Social Council, some
considered attention also appears to be necessary to the
2


Trusteeship Council. The suggestions made by the
Secretary-General seem to us to be wise and far-sighted.
The Principality of Monaco could support the idea of
entrusting that organ with new trusteeship responsibilities
in the spheres of the environment and the protection of the
common human patrimony. Outer space, the atmosphere,
the high seas, as well as the free zones of the Arctic and
Antarctic — especially in the spirit of the 1959 Treaty —
would all stand to gain, under certain conditions, by being
placed within its competence. The Council might also be
entrusted with the ongoing task of considering the great
transformations that would be entailed by predictable
advances in science and technology.
We must hope that the proposed reforms will be
speedily enacted, so that the Millennium Assembly
proposed by the Secretary-General for the year 2000 will
indeed be an occasion for celebrating an updated and
modernized United Nations.
The Principality, which this year is celebrating the
700th anniversary of my family's dynasty in Monaco, can
only wish long life to a United Nations strengthened and
more open to civil society.
Turning now to the nearer future, allow me to
emphasize the importance that my country attaches to
concluding the work on the international criminal court,
which should lead to a plenipotentiary diplomatic
conference next year in Rome. A collective morality that is
universal in scope cannot exist without institutions to
disseminate it, implement it and ensure its respect.
The adoption of a Convention on anti-personnel
landmines, which continue to inflict their savagery on
civilian populations, has long been one of our goals. Is not
respect for the dignity and physical integrity of human
beings one of the most essential and universally recognized
values, one that underlies both human rights and
humanitarian law?
The meeting convened by Canada last October and the
series of meetings held in Vienna, Bonn and Brussels this
year, as well as the diplomatic conference that recently took
place in Oslo have led to the drafting of a text, which, in
the spirit of resolution 51/45 S, prohibits not only the use
but also the development, stockpiling and transfer of such
mines. We truly welcome this development.
In the same vein, I should like to note that the
Principality has recently submitted its instruments of
accession to the Convention on Prohibitions or
Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons
Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to
Have Indiscriminate Effects, a Convention that we believe
constitutes great progress in the rules of warfare.
Next year will be the International Year of the
Ocean, for which we are making active preparations. The
marine environment laboratory of the International
Atomic Energy Agency in Monaco has recently moved
into new, spacious and functional offices made available
to it by our Government. That laboratory, thanks to its
modern equipment, is helping to identify sources and new
chemical markers of marine pollution. It regularly
organizes training courses and consultative missions, and
it is actively contributing, with the assistance of the
United Nations Environment Programme and the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, to the
MEDPOL programme to combat pollution in the
Mediterranean — an issue of great interest to us.
The International Year of the Ocean should provide
an opportunity to strengthen such programmes as well as
international cooperation to promote the preservation and
management of marine resources, including certain fish
stocks and marine mammals. At the nineteenth special
session of the General Assembly on the environment last
June, many delegations emphasized these issues. Echoing
the Commission on Sustainable Development, some quite
rightly recalled the need regularly to assess, on an
intergovernmental level and in the framework of the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the
quality of the marine environment. This has been done for
almost 20 years in France, Italy and Monaco under the
RAMOGE programme. We hope that other regional
cooperation activities of this nature will develop in 1998.
For coastal States as well as for the international
community, the oceans and the seas must be a protected,
shared space, sparingly exploited — not a place for
intense economic confrontation.
Finally, like the European Union, whose views on
many issues we share, the Principality of Monaco remains
very concerned by the continued financial crisis in the
United Nations. This crisis can be resolved only if
Member States comply strictly with their commitments
and pay in full, on time and without conditions their
contributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgets as
well as all accumulated arrears.

As a member of the International Olympic Committee,
I am pleased once again to remind the Assembly that the
Winter Olympic Games will be held next February in
Nagano, Japan. The General Assembly at its fifty-first
session invited Member States, through resolution 50/13, to
respect a truce before, during and after both the Summer
and Winter Olympic Games. Building a peaceful and better
world through sport and the Olympic ideal must remain our
motto at that great international meeting of the youth of the
world.
Finally, I should like to convey my deep sorrow,
shared by my father and by the people of Monaco, at the
loss of lives resulting from the forest fires — an ecological
cataclysm — that are raging in Sumatra, Indonesia, and
from the air disaster that occurred in Maden this morning,
as well as at the tragic results of last night's earthquake in
the Italian peninsula. I should like to extend, on my own
behalf and on behalf of my father and the people of
Monaco, our deepest condolences and sympathy.








"
MCO,2006,"Few 
women before you, Madam, have been elected to the 
presidency of the General Assembly, despite the fact 
that, as the Chinese proverb states, women hold up half 
the sky. We are delighted by your election and 
congratulate you and your country, Bahrain. Our 
congratulations go also to the Group of Asian States, 
which, happily, put your name forward. You can rest 
assured that our delegation will always be ready to 
support you as you carry out you lofty and challenging 
task. 
 We would also like to congratulate your 
predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, on 
having so successfully guided the work of the General 
Assembly during the previous session, as well as for 
his understanding of the capacity of Member States to 
overcome their differences. Because of his 
perseverance, the majority of the reforms resulting 
from the commitments entered into at the 2005 World 
Summit have been implemented. 
 At the beginning of this debate we heard Mr. Kofi 
Annan present his report on the work of the 
Organization (A/61/1) for the last time. He clearly set 
out for us his beliefs and accomplishments and his 
recommendations for strengthening the United Nations. 
My delegation associates itself with the numerous 
tributes paid to the Secretary-General. We also wish to 
convey to him our profound gratitude for his 
courageous efforts over the past 10 years. Thanks to 
the extensive experience he acquired at the 
Organization, he was able to move the United Nations 
forward — in an environment fraught with threats and 
new challenges — to meet the expectations aroused as 
a result of the upheavals caused by globalization. His 
clear vision made it possible to establish the existence 
of the nexus between peace, development and human 
rights — Charter principles that have repeatedly 
underpinned our common efforts.  
 Guided by the watchful motivation of His Serene 
Highness Prince Albert II, the Government of Monaco 
has worked to increase its contribution to development 
and international cooperation through a significant 
increase in official development assistance (ODA). In 
that connection, cooperation credits have increased by 
30 per cent in 2006. The Principality will continue its 
efforts to expeditiously reach the goals set and 
reaffirmed last year at this very rostrum by His Serene 
Highness the Sovereign Prince.  
 The advancement of women, improving child and 
maternal health and the alleviation of poverty are 
among the Principality’s priorities on the international 
sphere. The Sovereign Prince and his sisters, Princess 
Caroline of Hanover and Princess Stéphanie of 
  
 
06-53958 2 
 
Monaco, are greatly involved in development efforts 
intended to help the most destitute. In her capacity as a 
goodwill ambassador for the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Her 
Royal Highness the Princess of Hanover is helping to 
promote programmes to educate girls and women. Part 
of that effort includes a project undertaken by Monaco, 
Andorra, Cyprus, Luxembourg and San Marino on the 
theme of human rights and education in combating 
poverty and promoting the independence of girls and 
women. 
 As President of the World Association of 
Children’s Friends, the Princess has long led an 
ongoing struggle to protect children. On the recent 
occasion of being honoured by UNICEF-USA, the 
Princess of Hanover stated that “today we are at war 
against terror, especially against the terror in the eyes, 
hearts and spirits of millions of children around the 
world”. 
 This session will provide impetus to the effort to 
promote and protect the rights of children with next 
October’s publication of a study by the independent 
expert Paulo Pinheiro, to which the Principality is 
proud to have contributed. Let us not forget that, as 
Jean-Paul Sartre wrote, violence, regardless of what 
form it takes, constitutes a failure.  
 We hope that, following the Security Council’s 
debates on the protection of children in armed conflict, 
the effective implementation of Council resolution 
1620 (2005) will lead to progress in this area of such 
concern. It is unacceptable in human terms for the 
perpetrators of such crimes to go unpunished.  
 During her presence here last June to attend the 
High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, Princess Stéphanie 
of Monaco expressed her solidarity with all those 
fighting the disease or otherwise affected. Through her 
Fight AIDS Monaco association, the Princess is 
working to promote prevention, research and assistance 
to those affected by the virus — especially sero-
positive people, who are often victims of 
discrimination. In that regard, the Princess has 
expressed the wish that the dignity of every sero-
positive person be respected. Her association will 
support the establishment of an entity to provide 
psychological support for those ill with the disease in 
an African country where many non-governmental 
organizations from Monaco have already carried out 
development efforts.  
 The upcoming appointment of Princess Stéphanie 
as a special representative of the Joint United Nations 
Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) will further 
strengthen her commitment to the fight against this 
terrible pandemic, which is increasingly affecting more 
and more women. To address that situation, the 
Government of Monaco has decided that, in addition to 
the support it provides to UNAIDS, it will begin this 
year to finance a United Nations Population Fund 
project in Africa focusing mainly on sero-positive 
women suffering from extreme poverty and 
psychological distress and providing them with 
medical, psychological and social assistance.  
 Our heads of State or Government resolved to 
take action when they accepted the responsibility to 
protect. It is of course up to individual States to protect 
their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic 
cleansing and crimes against humanity. But when such 
tragic events cannot be prevented, it falls to the 
international community, working through the United 
Nations, to be prepared to immediately provide 
assistance to victims of such acts.  
 Whether a catastrophe is natural or man-made, it 
is crucial that we be able to meet the most pressing 
needs of civilian populations. In that regard, we would 
like to commend the Under-Secretary-General for 
Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief 
Coordinator and his Office for their ongoing efforts, 
especially as regards the restructuring of the Central 
Emergency Response Fund. Monaco is a contributor to 
the Fund and intends to continue its efforts to provide 
financing for humanitarian assistance during the years 
to come.  
 Before the end of this year, His Serene Highness 
Prince Albert II will once again visit the fishing village 
of Sirombu on Nias Island, Indonesia, which has twice 
been struck by natural disaster: first by a tidal wave in 
December 2004 and, a few months later, by an 
earthquake. The village has been rebuilt thanks to the 
effective and generous action of the Monaco-Asia 
Association.  
 As the Sovereign Prince announced that it would 
during the 2005 World Summit (see A/60/PV./6), 
Monaco ratified the Kyoto Protocol last February.  
 Our head of State has a personal and ongoing 
commitment to protecting the environment. That 
commitment was recently evidenced in the polar 
expedition he undertook 100 years after the one made 
 
 
3 06-53958 
 
by his great-great grandfather, Prince Albert I, a 
pioneer of modern oceanography. Having reached the 
North Pole with his team on 16 April 2006, following 
four days on an arduous course on dog sleds from the 
Russian base of Barneo, Prince Albert II launched an 
urgent appeal regarding the dangers of global warming, 
unfortunately in evidence in the Arctic in the 
significant shrinking of the ice shelf. Back in Monaco, 
His Serene Highness established a foundation devoted 
to environmental preservation and sustainable 
development that will serve as a permanent source of 
dynamic and innovative efforts in the areas of climate 
change, biodiversity loss and water resources.  The 
Principality is also pleased to have been elected to the 
United Nations Commission on Sustainable 
Development. We hope to contribute to improving the 
United Nations environmental machinery. 
 The Principality of Monaco believes that there is 
a need to establish and strengthen dialogue among 
civilizations in order to prevent conflict. We support all 
efforts aimed at actively promoting a culture of peace 
and mutual respect among the world’s various creeds, 
cultures and languages. As Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan stated in 1999, “The greater the appreciation of 
diversity, the deeper the sense of identity and the 
sounder the enlargement of the common denominator 
of values” (A/54/546, para. 13). 
 It is in that spirit that Monaco, aware of the 
universal value of sport as one of the best tools to 
establish inter-cultural dialogue, fully supports the 
United Nations Action Plan on Sport for Development 
and Peace. "
MCO,2005,"In 1945,
in the aftermath of a war that tore apart all the peoples
of the world - a war during which the most basic
human rights were violated - a few leading countries
came together at the San Francisco Conference, here in
the United States of America, and created the United
Nations. Collective security had to be restored, human
rights had to be reinstated and our world needed to
move towards greater justice and freedom.
Much has been achieved over the past 60 years.
Today, our Organization consists of 191 Member
States. We hope - and many heads of State or
Government expressed this wish during the recent
summit - that we are beginning a new phase in the
quest for collective security and respect for human
rights and in the fight against poverty and disease,
which continue to affect so many peoples.
To that end, the international community must be
better represented, particularly in the Security Council.
Further progress must also be made through the
establishment of the Human Rights Council, the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) to combat poverty and the more efficient
management of the Organization.
Once again, on behalf of His Serene Highness
Prince Albert II, I wish to pay tribute to the President
of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and
to you, Sir, on your election to the presidency at the
sixtieth session. I hope that, throughout our debates at
this session, the momentum for change will continue to
build. I would also like to pay tribute to the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has pursued
those noble objectives with tenacity and farsightedness.
The Principality of Monaco fully endorses the
outcome document, and will support its
implementation so that we can, together, achieve new
progress in the coming months.
The Government of the Principality of Monaco
has, over the past few years, reoriented its international
cooperation policy in order to contribute more
effectively to the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals. Thus, the main focus of Monacoís
cooperation policies are those defined in the
framework of the Millennium Development Goals: the
preservation of the environment in the broad sense of
the term; the fight against poverty; and support for
education and health care.
Monaco's official development assistance (ODA)
has continued to increase, multiplying fivefold in the
past 10 years - an effort that will continue in the years
to come with a view to reaching the 0.7 per cent target
as soon as possible. Likewise, we endorse the
Declaration on innovative sources of financing for
development.
Through its voluntary contributions to the United
Nations and several other institutions and agencies,
34

including the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization, the World Health
Organization, the Joint United Nations Programme on
HIV/AIDS, UNICEF, the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to name but
a few, the Principality sponsors activities aimed at
assisting developing countries and the most
underprivileged populations.
Over one third of our cooperation funding is
provided within the framework of multilateral
assistance, and the increase over the past few years
has, of course, also benefited bilateral assistance.
The General Assembly proclaimed 2005 as the
International Year of Microcredit in an effort to
promote such programmes globally. The Principality
has, for many years, accorded special attention to
microcredit, as part of our financing for development
programme, in particular through its cooperation with
UNDP. In this regard, funds provided by Monaco
provide support for small businesses in Africa that are
operating under conditions of extreme poverty, with a
view to improving the standard of living of the most
vulnerable people, particularly women.
Our cooperation efforts are directed mostly
towards the countries of the Mediterranean region and
the least developed countries in Africa, especially
those of sub-Saharan Africa, because we also believe
that we need to open up spaces for regional solidarity
throughout the world.
The Mediterranean is an ecoregion with which
the Principality has, historically, been closely involved.
The implementation of cooperation plans to protect the
Mediterranean environment, both coastal and marine,
is therefore a priority.
Monaco also provides assistance to a number of
French-speaking countries in areas relating largely to
poverty eradication, health care and education.
Working in complementarity with the Government,
Monacoís non-governmental organizations are also
committed in those countries. I would like to
underscore that the Principality is ready to participate,
to the best of its abilities and within its financial
means, in initiatives in the areas of health care and
training.
During his recent address from this rostrum,
Prince Albert II expressed great sadness in connection
with the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in
the United States.
Almost one year ago, South-East Asia suffered an
unprecedented natural disaster. The solidarity shown in
the aftermath of that tragedy and the effectiveness of
the response to it, on the part of not only humanitarian
workers but also civil society, make it clear that the
resources and the capacity do exist to allow for shared
responsibility for the future welfare of the peoples to
whom the Charter is dedicated. The Principality of
Monaco has mobilized` its efforts by undertaking a
great many private and public activities in this respect.
The Principality of Monaco has always been a
staunch defender of humanitarian law. We support in
principle and on the basis of our convictions any action
aimed at alleviating difficult situations resulting from
natural or manmade disasters.
The Principality of Monaco is a small State that
enjoys a certain level of wealth. It cannot change the
world on its own, but it intends to set an example in the
field of cooperation.
The creation of the Human Rights Council and
the establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission will
mark a turning point in the history of the Organization.
Even more importantly, they represent a response to
developments in multilateral relations.
In keeping with the document just adopted, the
General Assembly will also have to strengthen the
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights;
establish the rule of law assistance unit within the
Secretariat; and work constructively to ensure that the
emerging concept of responsibility to protect becomes
positive law as soon as possible.
In this regard, I would insist on the imperative
need to put an end to impunity for crimes committed
against children.
The defence of the rights and interests of children
has always been one of our major concerns. Indeed,
any act of violence against a child is a violation of the
lofty principles for which the United Nations stands. In
order to build ""a world fit for children"", in compliance
with the measures adopted during the special session of
the General Assembly on children, held in May 2002,
the Government of the Principality is deeply dedicated
to promoting the concept that there should be no statute
of limitations for the most serious violations of the
rights of children, and that we should expand the
35

powers of national jurisdictions by providing them
with universal competence in that area.
Prince Albert II, during his address to the General
Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, invited the
international community to give thought to a plan to
address the impunity that continues to prevail with
regard to the most heinous crimes committed against
children.
In that context, the Principality has stressed the
promotion of that concept in the resolution on the
Rights of the Child, adopted last year by the General
Assembly, and it has reaffirmed its position during the
session of the Human Rights Commission held last
April in Geneva. It is the wish of the Principality to
pursue its undertaking with the support of the
international community on those crucial matters.
In other respects, the Monegasque Government
has paid close attention and contributed financially to
the global study on violence against children led by
Professor Pinheiro, which will present its conclusions
in October 2006. Likewise, the Principality actively
participated, along with the European Council, in the
triennial programme of action - for the period 2005-
2007 - entitled ""Childhood and violence"", whose
conclusions, like that of the global study on violence
against children, will enable us to make specific
recommendations to States. The Principality of
Monaco will always support all international initiatives
aimed at enhancing the protection of children.
Respect for the environment is also one of our
concerns. Mr. President, it was in your country,
Sweden, just over three decades ago that environmental
law was born. The Stockholm Conference saw the
emergence of a discipline that met a need: to address
the protection of natural resources and of our
environment in an organized manner.
Furthermore, we have decided to join the Kyoto
Protocol, and we hope, in the tradition of the
Oceanographic Institute ó created 100 years ago by
Prince Albert I of Monaco ó to make our contribution
to studies on the future of our planet.
However, the United Nations Environment
Programme is no longer the ideal forum to coordinate
action and ensure its effectiveness because of the
extremely rapid expansion of this field and given the
many conventions, protocols and agreements that have
been adopted. That is why we support the idea of
creating a United Nations environmental body.
Globalization must not make us forget that we
come from different regions and cultures that should
enrich one another and not be a source of clashes or of
conflicts.
We believe in interaction between the United
Nations and regional organizations; one sets the
general rules, and the others facilitate their
implementation at the local level.
The reforms just adopted at the High-level
Plenary Meeting strengthen the unique position of the
General Assembly as the guarantor of the systemís
coherence.
I can assure the Assembly that Monaco will
continue resolutely to make its contribution, however
modest, to building a better world, with full respect for
our differences."
MCO,1998,"The principality of Monaco is particularly
pleased that you, Mr. President, are carrying out the high
functions and responsibilities of this fifty-third session of
our General Assembly. Your election by acclamation
bears witness to the confidence that the international
community has placed in your personal qualities and in
your experience. It is also a manifestation of the respect
that Member States have for your country, Uruguay.
I would also like to include the newly elected
members of the Bureau in my cordial congratulations to
you and in the wishes for success that I extend to you.
It is also a pleasant duty for me to pay a most
earnest and sincere tribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko,
who presided with such great talent and effectiveness over
the fifty-second of the Assembly.
Geography often dictates the fate of a nation. This
is particularly true for the Principality of Monaco, whose
life and development for centuries have depended on the
sea. So it is that my country has always attached great
importance to all issues concerning the sea. In fact, we
host several institutions devoted to the marine
environment.
In this International Year of the Ocean, it seems
fitting to recall that the Principality is also celebrating the
one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Prince
10


Albert I of Monaco, one of the founders of oceanography,
to whom our country owes a great deal of its renown.
My illustrious forebear, born in 1848, devoted a
substantial part of his life to the scientific study of the
oceans. An accomplished and passionate seaman, he was a
pioneer during 30 years of scientific study that led him
from the Azores to Spitzberg.
Prince Albert I created in Monaco in 1910 the
Oceanographic Museum in order to share what he had
learned from his maritime expeditions and to reveal the
beauty and wealth of the marine environment. Previously,
in Paris in 1906, he had founded the Oceanographic
Institute, which, in the same spirit, he devoted to teaching
and research.
He was also a forerunner of oceanology, in that some
of his work or his insights led to major medical discoveries,
such as anaphylaxis and antibacterial action. By advancing
research on what he called the meteorology of the upper
atmosphere of the oceans, he paved the way for studies of
oceanic atmospheric exchanges and their impact on climate.
Following his example, we should encourage
climatological studies in order to prevent as much as
possible such tragic flooding as that which — victimizing
too many people — rages today in Bangladesh, in China
and in the Chiapas region in Mexico. This is not to
overlook, of course, hurricane Georges, which is now
striking the Caribbean islands with such force.
In responding to the wishes of the Ninth International
Oceanographic Congress, on 30 March 1910 Prince Albert
I brought together a special commission to propose a
programme for the scientific exploration of the
Mediterranean. Because of the First World War, the general
constitutive conference could not be held until 1919, in
Madrid. In the presence of representatives of eight States
with coasts on the Mediterranean, the programme and
working methods of the international commission for the
scientific exploration of the Mediterranean were established.
The comprehensive activities of this institution, unique in
nature and mission, continue today. The institution brings
together very high-level political leaders and scientists. Last
June in Croatia it held its thirty-fifth meeting. Prince
Rainier III, my father, who is now the Chairman, took that
opportunity to again express his confidence in the scientific
community, encouraging it not to underestimate the
influence it might have on political decisions, especially in
the area of maritime affairs.
It is in this spirit that we attach special interest to
the work conducted by the Independent World
Commission on Oceans, under the leadership of the
former President of Portugal, Mario Soares. We hope that
its conclusions, which are essential for the lasting
conservation of our marine heritage, will receive all the
attention they deserve.
Inspired by the scientific work of Prince Albert I,
Prince Rainier III, my father, and his Government have in
recent years continued and strengthened his visionary
policy. Two examples are the scientific centre established
in 1960 and the RAMOGE agreement signed with France
and Italy so as to prevent all types of pollution — which
are numerous in the Ligurian Sea.
Furthermore, since last 27 March the Principality has
had a law that brings together in one legislative body all
provisions relating to the law of the sea, conforming them
to the legal and technical requirements of the
contemporary maritime world — first and foremost to the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and
other relevant international instruments to which Monaco
is a party.
We are also very much involved in activities carried
out by the International Whaling Commission. Our efforts
recently led to the establishment of 40 degrees south as
the boundary of the new southern sanctuary designed to
ensure protection for the feeding and reproduction
grounds of 90 per cent of large whales. The Governments
affected by this decision have committed themselves to
limit the number of so-called scientific hunting permits in
order to protect effectively this sanctuary.

I would like, furthermore, to draw the attention of
the General Assembly to fresh threats to the marine
environment posed by new synthetic chemical products,
such as dioxins and certain pesticides which affect the
neurological and brain development of many species.
Large amounts of these products are now found in the
flesh of fish and other marine vertebrates in the northern
hemisphere, presenting an imminent threat not only to the
balance of marine biodiversity but also to the health of
the human race. I am thinking in particular of the Beluga
whales, now among the most poisoned animals on our
planet.
11


The substantial contribution of Prince Albert I to
progress in oceanography should not allow us to forget his
research in other areas, such as the study of prehistory.
Thanks to discoveries made in coastal caves, it has enabled
us to identify one of the links in human evolution, which
has helped to establish scientifically the common origin of
the human race. These fossils, along with other
archaeological objects found in the caves of the region, are
preserved in the Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology,
which the Prince created in 1902 in Monaco. Just as he had
established the Oceanographic Institute in Paris to promote
marine sciences, Prince Albert I gave the French capital an
Institute of Human Paleontology, where since 1910 courses
have been given and interdisciplinary research has been
conducted on geology, prehistoric paleontology and
ethnography.
Like many scholars, Prince Albert I did not limit his
activities to research. He felt the profound need for
communication, teaching and propagation of knowledge. He
gave talks in Italy, Belgium, Spain and Austria. He
inaugurated congresses in Paris, Bordeaux and Washington.
One could also see him in the outskirts of the French
capital giving night classes to workers enrolled in the
People?s University of Paris. Prince Albert I probably
anticipated the immense enthusiasm with which at the
beginning of the 1960s men and women of all disciplines
and a large part of the peoples of the world were to come
together in favour of ecology — that is, respect for nature,
its balance and the interdependence of the beings that live
in it. Since the beginning of the century he had perceived
some of the bases for an environmentalism which was both
popular and scientific and which he himself tried to put into
practice.
So it is that his temple of the sea, the Oceanographic
Institute Museum of Monaco, was, on his initiative,
surrounded by superb gardens containing original and
varied Mediterranean species. Also very interested in
botany, he established on the rocky, arid coast of Monaco
an exotic garden open to the public where we find
succulent plants, some very rare and endangered, preserved
with great care. My ancestor was to some extent a
forerunner of those involved in the defence of biodiversity.
A profound believer in justice and an ardent defender
of universal friendship, Prince Albert I in 1903 also created
in Monaco the International Institute for Peace, where he
brought together jurists, economists, philosophers and
scientists to whom he assigned the mission of considering
“ways of solving disputes between nations, propagating
dedication to methods for bringing about harmonious
understanding, and eradicating hatred from the hearts of
peoples”. Forty-two years later these words echoed in the
preamble to the United Nations Charter adopted in San
Francisco.
The Academy for Peace and International Security,
which meets regularly in Monaco, perpetuates, on the
initiative of my father, the reigning Prince, the
determination of Prince Albert I to promote research on
peace and the causes of conflict as well as the study of
war. Its thirtieth session, which I was pleased to open on
19 March, devoted its work to globalization and
international security. The discussions were led by high-
ranking personalities from the worlds of diplomacy,
defence and business, as well as by representatives of
major international organizations. Its recommendations
and conclusions essentially deal with the risks of tension
and conflict inherent in the globalization of the economy
and the best ways to overcome these risks.
The interest in humankind expressed in his research
on primitive man and his environment, his commitment
to scientific knowledge and its spread, his rejection of
violence and his tireless fight for peace and respect for
nature are all very contemporary messages which Prince
Albert I bequeathed to us. This was the meeting of a
human life with history, and his multidimensional legacy
has come to us through time. He has influenced the minds
of the people of Monaco, generation upon generation, in
making us a welcoming, peace-loving people, respectful
of our environment. Enriched by and adapted to world
developments and progress by his successors, primarily
my father, this heritage is now at the core of essential
missions which we have entrusted to the United Nations.
My country, within its modest means, is more prepared
than ever to make its experience, inherited from its
difficult past, available for understanding and
rapprochement.
The defence of human rights and respect for human
dignity, which are inscribed in letters of gold in the
United Nations Charter, were no doubt of inspiration to
Prince Albert I when he personally committed himself to
the rehabilitation of Captain Dreyfus and when he decided
to grant constitutional political rights to his subjects in
1911.
These fundamental human rights are being
commemorated by the international community today.
This is a great event. Fifty years ago, on 10 December
1948, our General Assembly at its third session, held in
Paris at the Palais de Chaillot, adopted the Universal
12


Declaration of Human Rights. One of those primarily
responsible for it, the French professor René Cassin,
received in 1968, 20 years after the solemn proclamation,
the Nobel Peace Prize. This commemoration should be an
opportunity for collective soul-searching. To what extent
are human rights enjoyed internationally? Above all, what
is the position with regard to the initiatives taken to realize
the right to development, which was officially recognized
in 1993 by the international community at the World
Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna?
The current fierce economic competition which is
aggravating macroeconomic imbalances is not without an
impact on the enjoyment of human rights. While respect for
civil and political rights seems to be less affected,
economic, social and cultural rights underpinning the right
to development have made only modest progress — where
they have not, indeed, met with major setbacks.
The current financial crisis is depriving millions of
men and women of their basic rights, when not actually
destroying their lives. At the world level, it has led to an
overall drop in life expectancy, an increase in infant and
maternal mortality, greater unemployment, growing
insecurity, uncontrolled migration and a grave deterioration
in social welfare, accompanied by a relentless drop in
income among the active population. The high-level
dialogue on the theme of the social and economic impact of
globalization and interdependence and their policy
implications, which was held in this Hall on 17 and 18
September, clearly stressed these facts.
Human rights are indissoluble. They must be enjoyed
by everyone everywhere. As the General Assembly
proclaimed on 10 December 1948, they are a common
standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. The
highest authorities of my country, along with the entire
Monegasque people, are thoroughly convinced of this.
One thought comes to mind. It may be a lengthy one,
since the question is delicate and quite complex. The
Government of the Principality is perfectly well aware that
urgent and concrete steps must be encouraged at the
national and global levels. Mrs. Mary Robinson, the High
Commissioner for Human Rights, has our full support and
all our confidence. We know how difficult her task is and
how pitiful are her resources in the face of reality.
The Principality of Monaco also attaches the highest
importance to the tireless and courageous work of the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, which, I am pleased to recall, received the Nobel
Peace Prize nearly 45 years ago in 1954. Mrs. Sadako
Ogata and her colleagues deserve our support and respect.
The United Nations humanitarian activities, which
are necessary today as never before, and its efforts to
eliminate anti-personnel landmines and the human tragedy
they entail also deserve our greatest encouragement.
I wish here to emphasize the special interest which
my father, the Sovereign Prince, and I, President of the
Red Cross of Monaco — currently celebrating its fiftieth
anniversary — attach to respect for and strict
implementation of the Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12
August 1949. Despite the tireless efforts of the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies, as well as of many humanitarian organizations
that I wish to commend here for the altruism and courage
of their members, we note an increase in serious
violations of this text, as well as of the most basic human
rights of the most vulnerable sectors of the population,
including children.
Last June, the Security Council rightly expressed its
grave concern at the terrible consequences to children of
armed conflict. It energetically and unequivocally
condemned the abuses to which they are subject,
especially the humiliations, outrages, sexual violence,
kidnapping and displacements, as well their recruitment
and use in combat, in violation of current international
law. The authorities of Monaco unreservedly share that
position and are prepared to lend active support, to the
extent of their abilities, to the Secretary-General?s Special
Representative for Children in Armed Conflict so that he
may fulfil his noble mission.
Unfortunately, the fate of children may be equally
tragic outside armed conflict. Following the World
Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of
Children, held in Stockholm in August 1996, the
Government of Monaco, as I stated to the General
Assembly at its fifty-first session, has striven to reform its
criminal legislation in order to bring it into line with its
commitments. In implementation of article 34 of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Monaco
is Party, new legislative provisions have been enacted,
with broader scope to criminalize to the greatest possible
extent the sexual exploitation of children to satisfy the
vices of others.
The establishment, last July in Rome, of an
International Criminal Court is a source of great hope.
13


This represents major progress, a far-reaching change in the
international order that fosters respect for the essential
principles of humanitarian law. Its Statute, adopted by a
large majority, opens the way to the prosecution of war
crimes and the most heinous crimes against humanity, many
of which affect children, of course, but also woman and the
defenceless elderly. The Principality of Monaco, which
participated in the Diplomatic Conference in Rome,
welcomes this historic decision.
The Royal Government is grateful that such weighty
issues as the definition of crimes, the principle of
complementarity, jurisdictions, the independence of the
prosecutor?s office and relations with United Nations organs
were all solved satisfactorily.
I also wish to express on behalf of my country our
great satisfaction at the work which the Secretary-General
has done in recent months. The reports he submits to us
note progress in many areas, including administrative and
financial management and the restructuring of the
Secretariat. Outstanding progress has been achieved thanks
to the trusting and close cooperation he has established with
representatives of Member States and with officials of the
most influential international world and regional bodies.
His diplomatic initiatives, carried out with great
wisdom, patience and determination, have often been
crowned with success, despite the obstacles and difficulties
he has encountered. We are especially pleased that, in come
cases, his initiatives have allowed us to prevent or stabilize
conflicts that might otherwise have been extremely
devastating.
The Secretary-General?s well-written and incisive
report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of
durable peace and sustainable development in Africa has
riveted our attention. It is a valuable source of inspiration
and ideas for bringing peace to Africa.
In this respect, I cannot fail to recall that we are
commemorating this year the fiftieth anniversary of
peacekeeping operations. It was in 1948 that the first
United Nations observer mission was established. I take this
opportunity to pay a tribute to all those men and women
who have served under the United Nations flag and to
salute the memory of those who gave their lives in the line
of duty. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld was among
them. More recently, in Kabul, an Italian Lieutenant
Colonel was killed and a French military adviser wounded.
The Convention on the Safety of United Nations and
Associated Personnel, adopted by the General Assembly at
its forty-ninth session, is more relevant than ever. Ten
years ago, on 10 December 1988, United Nations
Peacekeeping Forces received the Nobel Peace Prize. As
I see it, this high distinction should be recalled on the
occasion of this anniversary.
I would like to express great sadness felt in my
country over the accident of Swissair flight 111. My
saddest thoughts go to the victims of that accident, some
of whom belonged to the great United Nations family. We
share the grief of their loved ones.
Africa and Europe have recently experienced a tragic
series of terrorist attacks that have taken a toll of
hundreds of victims including women, children,
elderly people, many of whom were present merely by
chance. Those attacks have given rise to an inevitable
escalation of the use of force and an increased risk of
conflict. The authorities and people of Monaco have felt
these painful events very deeply. Through me, they wish
to reaffirm to the Governments concerned and to the
families of the victims their solidarity and their deepest
sympathy.
On 13 August 1995, the Security Council firmly
condemned acts of terrorism, which they called an
outrage. It recalled its statement of 31 January 1992,
issued at its high-level meeting of heads of State and
Government. The Principality of Monaco agrees fully
with that position. It is perfectly aware that terrorism
endangers not only the security of States and their
citizens, but also international cooperation and peace. My
country is more convinced than ever of the need to
strengthen international cooperation, with a view to
combating more effectively this scourge, which is a
serious and tragic setback in relations among human
beings, nations and peoples. It fully endorses the
provisions of General Assembly resolution 52/165,
adopted on 15 December 1997, and its provisions aimed
at the elimination of international terrorism.
Our Government is now considering the possibility
of adhering to the International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, which was adopted
last year without a vote and which is currently open for
signature. Furthermore, we hope that negotiations under
way on a draft convention on the suppression of acts of
nuclear terrorism will be concluded quickly.
In conclusion, it is my hope that the work of this
fifty-third session of the General Assembly will be
crowned with success and that the activities of the
14


Organization will be strengthened in such vital areas as
international security, disarmament, sustainable development
and the protection of the environment.

MCO,2018,"In February, President Espinosa Garcés presented her strategic vision for the seventy-third session of the General Assembly: “Dialogue and strengthening of multilateralism as a  catalyst  for  the  well-being  of all persons and a sustainable  planet”.  We  welcome her commitment to the theme “Making the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”.
The delegation of Monaco will support her so that, together, we can contribute to aligning our institutions with the Sustainable Development Goals to  ensure that the high-level political forum that we will hold here next year delivers  the  necessary  adjustments  for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Dialogue and the promotion of multilateralism with a human face were also priorities of her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák.  Under  his  presidency,  the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session facilitated the vital progress necessary for United Nations decisions to remain relevant. I would particularly like to emphasize the repositioning of the United Nations system for development as well as the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which is to be formally adopted in Marrakech in December. We warmly thank him for having always listened to our representatives and for having prioritized the common interest, which is the guarantor for the success of multilateralism.
As the General Assembly commemorates the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December, how can we not recall the fact that, as the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations states, the reason that we, nations great and small, have committed to working together is “for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples”?
I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Bachelet for having rightly taken up the torch of Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein as United Nations High
 
Commissioner for Human Rights. We assure her of our support and congratulate Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein on never having avoided difficulties and on having assiduously championed the defence of human rights.
The United Nations and its Member States have continuously adapted to the new challenges posed by violence, conflict, transnational organized crime and the global scourge of terrorism. When the Security Council acts, it does so to ensure on behalf of all States international security and the protection of civilians. When the Council is prevented from acting, civilians, in particular women and children, pay an even higher price. In that regard, can we ignore the report of the Secretary-General (A/72/865), which notes in its paragraph 5 that in 2017, armed conflicts resulted in 6,000 proven cases of violations committed against children by Government forces and more than 15,000 by non-State armed groups? That is why Monaco supported the code of conduct regarding Security Council action against mass atrocity crimes at the seventieth session of the General Assembly.
In that spirit, we strongly condemn attacks against schools and hospitals, sexual violence and the denial of access to humanitarian aid. We firmly believe  in the role of women in peace processes. We support the involvement of young people in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. In that understanding, Monaco supports Security Council resolutions on such issues.
As the Monaco Red Cross celebrates its seventieth anniversary this year, I would like to recall the Principality’s commitment to strengthening respect for international humanitarian law. We also take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the men and women who have dedicated their lives to the Organization, tirelessly working to ensure that United Nations values prevail, and to the peacekeepers and United Nations officials who have died in the discharge of their mission.
Our country strongly supports the appointment by the Secretary-General of a Victims’ Rights Advocate, entrusted with placing rights and dignity at the heart of the Organization’s efforts and the zero-tolerance policy towards sexual harassment. We also hope that the principle of the responsibility to protect, contained in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), will at last be acknowledged and harnessed as a tool for progress accepted by all.
Since joining the United Nations, Monaco has significantly strengthened its legal arsenal. Over
the past 25 years, Monaco has ratified, adhered to or accepted more than 40 international treaties on human rights, refugees, privileges and immunities, criminal issues, disarmament, the environment and the law of the sea and has signed eight such treaties.
Even if today less than 10 per cent of the world’s population lives below the poverty line, the fact  is  that millions of human beings, including women and children, still live below that threshold and consequently are without access to education, health care, decent housing and work and opportunities for economic and social development.
In a world where artificial intelligence is developing and where genetic engineering and cyberspace are realities for many of us, how can we  disregard the fact that more than 68 million people were forcibly displaced in 2017 and that the United Nations has delivered assistance to a record number of 105 million people in 40 countries? Is it acceptable that three out of 10 people do not have access to safe drinking water and six out of 10 to sanitation? The Central Emergency Response Fund, to which the Principality contributes, has also funded emergency assistance in 36 countries to the tune of $418 million.
As we know, the many crises and challenges that  I have mentioned are interlinked. In that spirit, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). However, what is the paramount challenge facing our human societies today? It is clearly that of climate change. Its systemic effects spare no region of the world and equally are factors in the geopolitical upheaval that exacerbates the inequality and conflict that daily we strive to combat in this forum. Today, if we do not act ambitiously and effectively to combat that scourge, tomorrow we will have to be ready to live on a devastated planet, where it will be very difficult to maintain peace.
I  therefore endorse  the   Secretary-General’s call, issued earlier this month, to end the paralysis, indifference and weak commitments to the challenge of climate change. Today, the term “crisis” is nearly obsolete. As Mr. Guterres recalled, to prevent the worst, we must change course by 2020. That is why it is imperative that the negotiations of the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change, to be held in Katowice, result in the adoption of rules
 
allowing for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. For future generations, we must rise to that challenge.
Monaco is no exception to that framework. At the national level, the energy transition pact, launched at the beginning of the year, is ambitious and seeks to achieve the goal set by His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of achieving carbon neutrality by  2050  following  a 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. That initiative represents a new concrete action by the Royal Government in order to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The pact is a partnership among all elements of society and demonstrates the will of the Sovereign Prince for Monaco to remain a land of innovation, all the more so if that is likely to accelerate the transition to a carbon-free world.
In that regard, we also welcomed with the keenest interest the Secretary-General’s intention to convene a climate summit in 2019. A few days before, Monaco will have hosted a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change  with  a  view  to  issuing the special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate.
The maxim that there is no development without peace and no peace without development has continuously guided our work since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. However, progress is uneven and sometimes too slow to ensure that all the goals and targets will be met by 2030. That necessary adaptation to the challenges of  implementing the 2030  Agenda is an important step towards initiating a paradigm shift that will bring more coherence, efficiency and visibility to the work of our Organization, even though it is of course the primary duty of each Member State to remain mobilized.
In that regard, Monaco also prioritizes partnerships in its international cooperation given the long-standing evidence. We can achieve our united actions only by leveraging best practices and by constantly reviewing the technical opportunities based on our past experience.
Our cooperation with local non-governmental organizations in partner countries is based on trust and human involvement. The size  of  our  territory has naturally led us to look towards others. Trust in the links established with Monaco’s 11 international cooperation partnership countries makes  it  possible to support exclusively through grants more than 130 projects a year in priority sectors, namely, education, health,  food  security and socioeconomic integration.
The Principality remains a committed and resolute partner in doing its part to make the new paradigm of sustainable development a reality for all.
Our faith in multilateralism is anchored in the reality of a world of evolving threats. The Principality of Monaco shoulders its responsibility by implementing the principle of one State, one vote enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Monaco is convinced that the United Nations alone remains a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations towards shared goals. The authors of the Charter were visionaries. Like them, we must constantly renew our commitment to saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war.
In conclusion, allow me to quote Seneca, who  said: “It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.” Given the proliferation of challenges, let us dare to stand closer together. Even if not everything will be resolved in an easily measurable time frame, let us promote understanding among people and respect for our differences. I would be remiss if I did not reiterate our full trust in Mr. António Guterres and his transformative initiatives, which will make the United Nations better suited and more likely to effectively and efficiently meet the challenges of tomorrow.
"
MCO,2009,"My 
participation in this general debate, like that of more 
than 100 heads of State and Government, confirms 
both the seriousness of the choices we must make in 
the face of the challenges confronting our States and 
the unavoidable role of the United Nations in deciding 
on the future of our planet and its inhabitants. 
 More than ever before, the General Assembly 
must be the “centre for harmonizing the actions of 
nations” in the attainment of the common ends defined 
in Article 1 of the Charter. To remain the vital centre, 
the Organization and its most representative body of 
the community of nations — our General Assembly — 
must better take into consideration the interdependence 
that links our destinies and the opportunity presented to 
our sovereign States to bestow upon our fellow 
countrymen a common vision marked by moral values. 
 The financial storm that swept through the world 
a year ago has caused too much suffering and too much 
harm to the global economy, at a time in our history 
when we are confronted with the major challenges of 
the climate crisis and the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), for us not to 
draw obvious conclusions. 
 A year from now, we will meet again in this same 
forum to take stock of the progress we have made in 
the implementation of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs). The 2015 deadline — which already 
seemed compromised on the eve of this 
multidimensional crisis — requires that we define a 
global vision for the future of humankind. Some will 
call it solidarity or moral awareness. Whatever the 
 
 
11 09-52228 
 
name, we need to clearly define and implement the 
MDGs to meet the basic needs of all human beings. 
 If poverty eradication is to remain our priority, 
we will have to get busy on fulfilling our obligations, 
for the most destitute are also the ones who are hungry, 
who suffer from malnutrition and who lack access to 
water and to basic social and health services. Among 
the main victims are women and children, 25,000 of 
whom die each day, according to UNICEF. 
 Several hundred thousand people today benefit 
from actions undertaken by my country in the 
framework of its international cooperation in the fields 
of health, education and the fight against poverty. This 
is why I requested that we continue our effort to 
contribute 0.7 per cent of our GDP by 2015 to official 
development assistance. This assistance must not be 
sacrificed because of the present economic and 
financial situation. On the contrary, it must be 
strengthened at a time when the most vulnerable are 
the ones who need it the most. This development 
assistance must be accompanied by long-term 
investments aimed at strengthening the capacity-
building of developing countries, in particular through 
the transfer of appropriate technologies with a view to 
respecting the requirements of sustainable 
development. 
 From this perspective, and in the light of the 
recent food crisis, the time is right to restore 
agriculture to its proper place, because food security 
depends on it. Today, it is up to us to forge for future 
generations a new destiny, “a new deal”. We must 
move from being donors to become partners in a green 
revolution in Africa, where food-producing agriculture 
adapted to the specific conditions of the continent must 
empower the local populations. 
 The restoration of agriculture to the heart of our 
civilization also raises the crucial issue of water. 
Whether regarding access to it for the survival of our 
populations, for farming or for energy production, it is 
imperative to guarantee water security. Therefore, an 
integrated management of water resources is needed. 
We must be aware of the potential disasters and 
conflicts that would arise if we failed, and of risks 
linked to poor sanitation that could cause outbreaks of 
infectious diseases and pandemics. 
 The phenomena of desertification and drought, as 
well as the acidification of seas and oceans, are 
exacerbated by man-made climatic change. This is why 
failure of the Copenhagen negotiations is not an option. 
My commitment, and that of my worldwide 
counterparts, as stated yesterday in the framework of 
the climate change summit convened by the Secretary-
General, is unequivocal: we must, together — 
developed countries, countries with high carbon 
dioxide emissions and developing countries — succeed 
in defining a post-Kyoto regime that will be decidedly 
in line with a low-carbon-emission future. 
 For too long, we have neglected the scientific 
warnings. More than 20 years ago, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was 
created by the World Meteorological Organization. 
During the third World Climate Conference at the 
beginning of September which, with great pleasure, I 
attended, it was decided to establish a Global 
Framework for Climate Services, with a view to 
helping populations meet this increasingly pressing 
challenge. 
 This Global Framework, which we fully support, 
aims at improving the management of the risks of 
climate fluctuations and climate change as well as 
adaptation to climate change at all levels, through 
development and the incorporation of science-based 
information and forecasting into policies and planning. 
The unparalleled mobilization of public opinion 
compels us to adopt innovative measures to slow 
global warming, whose consequences could be 
catastrophic. 
 The Trade and Development Report recommends 
deep structural changes, which will not happen unless 
we are willing to challenge our patterns of production 
and consumption. The setting up of a green economy 
must be the basis of such a process. Our role, as 
political decision makers, is to ensure that the 
necessary technology — which already exists — is put 
to use to reduce greenhouse gases. Sustainable 
development requires the globalization of green 
technologies and environmental assets. 
 On behalf of the Principality, I reiterate our stated 
ambition to become carbon neutral and our resolve to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 
2020 and by 60 per cent by 2050. 
 During these past few months, the world 
economy has been sorely tried and tested. Signs of 
recovery are beginning to show, but we must draw 
lessons from this grim year. The globalization of the 
economy and the resulting interdependence require 
  
 
09-52228 12 
 
reform of the international monetary and financial 
system. 
 Created 10 years ago, the Group of 20 (G-20) met 
for the first time at the level of heads of State or 
Government last November, thereby acknowledging 
the urgency of adopting measures to save the world 
economy from a disaster worsened by the panic 
reigning in the financial markets. Monaco 
acknowledges that this group, which represents two 
thirds of the world’s population and trade and close to 
90 per cent of the world gross domestic product, bears 
special responsibility vis-à-vis the rest of the 
international community. 
 We are confident of the capacity of the G-20, 
tomorrow in Pittsburgh, to lay the foundations for a 
new era encompassing, inter alia, financial regulation, 
financial traders’ income, governance and resources 
allocated to international financial institutions. The 
G-20’s ability to bring together all States will give rise 
to the legitimacy necessary for renewed growth. 
 For several months, my Government has been 
working to fulfil the commitments it undertook and to 
comply with the required norms of the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with 
a view to improve transparency and exchanges of fiscal 
and banking information. That is why my Government 
has already signed 12 bilateral conventions and has 
undertaken to conclude other agreements in this area. 
As of today, Monaco has had its efforts acknowledged 
by the OECD and will thus now be included on its 
White List. 
 But let us make no mistake: the breach of trust 
resulting from the financial disaster has made it more 
necessary than ever before that the measures taken by 
the G-20 be non-discriminatory and bring together all 
Member States. A consultative body would thus ensure 
the legitimacy of any decisions made. 
 We must, together, rebuild solid foundations for a 
capitalism with a human face that promotes growth and 
social development. Current circumstances have 
provided us the opportunity to create a green economy, 
one which associates job creation with the transfer of 
new technologies which will enable us to achieve a 
sustained recovery. 
 The State must continuously adapt its role and the 
expression of its sovereignty to new realities in order 
to remain the guarantor of the security and social well-
being of populations. The United Nations cannot avoid 
this either. Since its creation, the Organization has 
worked for the maintenance of international peace and 
security through operations led under its flag. It has 
also played a prominent federative role in the field of 
disarmament and non-proliferation. 
 Human and material resources available to 
peacekeeping operations have reached levels that 
would have not been conceivable only a decade ago. 
The necessary consideration of this matter initiated 
within the Security Council and the Secretariat, as well 
as with Member States, is a priority and we support it. 
 What is just as important is the strengthening of 
the rule of law and of democratic institutions, 
guardians of sovereignty and the peaceful coexistence 
of States. In this respect, I wish to reiterate the support 
of my country for the implementation of the 
responsibility to protect, which is symbolic of the 
strengthening of multilateralism for the good of 
populations. The responsibility to protect does not 
affect the exercise of responsible sovereignty, which 
places the individual at the forefront. Monaco will 
continue to work with its partners — that is, each and 
every one in this Hall — to implement best practices in 
the field of protection, international assistance and 
capacity-building, with the sole objective of saving 
lives. 
 The Principality will keep responding, in 
solidarity, to emergency humanitarian situations, 
especially when it comes to assisting women and 
children, whose vulnerability in crisis situations, 
unfortunately, no longer needs to be demonstrated.  
 In 2010, we will celebrate the International Year 
for the Rapprochement of Cultures and the 
International Year of Biodiversity. These themes 
symbolize, at the outset of the twenty-first century, the 
harmony that we must seek both among our people — 
with acceptance of our differences — and between the 
human species and the other living species on Earth, 
which we have the duty to protect and save from 
extinction. 
 I can assure the Assembly that my country will 
continue to tirelessly commit itself to processes likely 
to build and strengthen the ties between our societies in 
order to promote dialogue and cultural and religious 
understanding based on mutual respect, such as the 
Union for the Mediterranean and the Alliance of 
Civilizations.

 I am convinced that the President’s great 
experience at the United Nations and his role in the 
creation of the African Union are great pluses for the 
success of his very sensitive mission."
MCO,2000,"Allow
me, first of all, to congratulate you most warmly, Mr.
President, on your election to the presidency of the
fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Allow me
also to express the conviction that under your authority
our work will be conducted with the same high level of
vision and competence demonstrated by the President
of your country, Ms. Tarja Halonen, in her
Co-Chairpersonship of the Millennium Summit at the
side of the President of Namibia, Mr. Sam Nujoma. I
also extend my thanks and congratulations to the
Secretary-General, who continues to imbue the
international Organization and the entire international
staff he commands with the virtues of rigour,
moderation and integrity that he embodies in his
service to the great ideals of the Organization.
Those are the same ideals that have just been
reaffirmed by the Heads of State and Government.
They also reaffirmed their confidence in the capacity of
the United Nations to ensure the advancement of, and
respect for, those ideals so long as the international
community gives the Organization the necessary
support through a renewed commitment.
For a small State such as Monaco, nothing is
more important than such a reaffirmation of the ideals
that should govern relations between sovereign States
in a spirit of equality and dignity. It is not a question of
disregarding the profound differences that may exist
between States with regard to their objective
characteristics, influence or weight in the affairs of the
world. However, it is appropriate to reaffirm the fact
that, no matter how small, each State should enjoy the
right to respect, and that all States are be bound by the
same rules in conducting international affairs.
Its history of over seven centuries makes it
possible for Monaco to gauge what that reaffirmation
represents, a reaffirmation supported by the common
determination of all States represented here. For its
2

part, the Principality associates itself fully with the
impetus provided by the Millennium Summit. To the
extent it is able, Monaco intends to contribute to
developing the full potential of that impetus.
Allow me, before I touch on the principal issues
we will be dealing with at this session  in which
Monaco has a longstanding interest  to address a
topic that seems to require some clarification: the
Principality of Monaco itself.
Though the notoriety enjoyed by the Principality
seems well established, since the whole world has
heard of it, all too often people have a one-sided view
of it in which it is reduced to a set of appealing but
vaguely archaic clichÈs.
Many people still believe that the casino is the
main source of income for the State, while in fact the
assessment paid by the SocietÈ des Bains de Mer,
which manages the casino, yields only 4 per cent of
public revenue. The rest derives primarily from taxes
and income from public property. In truth, the structure
of our budget is not very different from that of any
other country. As concerns expenses, many might envy
us, as we are able each year to devote a third of our
resources to investing in civil engineering projects.
Many people also believe that we depend to a
large extent on tourism. We are pleased, of course, that
Monaco attracts about 6 million visitors a year. But
here again reality contradicts the image of a tourism-
dependent economy, because tourism accounts for only
10 per cent of the principality's revenues. Of the rest,
40 per cent  are the product of local or international
commerce, 20 per cent of banking activities, 10 percent
of industrial activities  emanating from about 100
high-technology, non-polluting companies  and the
rest derive from a variety of services.
Clearly, Monaco, rather than being a sort of old-
style paradise for a happy few, has all the
characteristics of a highly developed country.
In this connection, we must also note to what
extent the Principality provides jobs in the region.
Though Monaco has 30,000 residents, it has 38,000
workers, some 30,000 of which live outside of Monaco
and commute to the Principality every day, which
enables them and their families to enjoy the same
social benefits and educational, sports and medical
amenities as the people of Monaco themselves.
Monaco is undoubtedly a small country, but it
does not live in the past. On the contrary, we have a
broad and modern outlook, and it is this vision that has
enabled us to become a highly developed State that use
state-of-the-art technology and is involved in massive
projects, such as the one that has enabled us to build
out over the sea and thus expand our territory by more
than 20 per cent during the reign of the current
Sovereign Prince.
Although all of this is based on unarguable fact,
some still question the source of our prosperity. To our
surprise and indignation, we recently heard it said that
the Principality was too lenient with respect to certain
criminal activities. Quite the opposite: we have sought
ways and means of combating criminal activities and
have consistently reaffirmed our will to strengthen the
measures we take to meet the challenges of today.
All foreign activities require Government
authorization, which is granted only following an in-
depth investigation. Nearly every week the
Governmental Council must veto certain projects. In
the area of banking and finance, monitoring systems
have been set up, and here we also rely on the help of
our great friend and neighbour, France. The legislation
in place to combat money-laundering is the same as
that in most developed countries. In fact, in certain
areas, it is even more stringent.
Monaco has set up an information and monitoring
service on financial flows to allow for the involvement
of legal authorities when necessary and for the
exchange of information with the equivalent foreign
institutions. The Principality is in no way a laissez-
faire zone in which all types of wealth can be
accumulated. Nor can it be termed an `opaque'
financial venue, unless we believe that transparency
does not exist anywhere.
Some see Monaco as a kind of fiscal paradise, as
if we had attempted to create artificial mechanisms to
attract floating capital and wealthy people trying to
avoid taxation in their own countries. The truth is that
direct taxation was abolished in 1869, at a time when
there was no tax on the income of natural persons
anywhere in the world, and thus competition could not
have been an issue. The fact that this situation
continues to prevail today certainly places Monaco
among the countries having `soft' tax laws. But there
are, in fact, taxes: two-thirds of the country's income
emanates from direct or indirect fiscal contributions,
3

that is to say, the value-added tax and the tax on the
profits realized from commercial, industrial and
intellectual activities.
In sum, Monaco is a highly developed country
that wishes to be an active participant in the European
sphere and that observes all international commitments
to combat present-day scourges such as financial
criminality and money laundering, which pose a clear
threat to the equilibrium of financial systems. The
Principality is, by its very nature, supportive of its
environment, but this is also the will of leadership.
I now turn to the basis of its external activities,
which also reflect its status as a small State focusing on
a few areas in which its tradition, experience and
abilities can provide added value at the international
level.
One of our priorities has always been
humanitarian action and social development. This was
made clear when, on 26 June last, His Serene Highness
the Hereditary Prince of Monaco, signed, in the
presence of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, the two Optional Protocols to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, on the
involvement of children in armed conflict and on the
sale of children, child prostitution and child
pornography.
The actions taken in relation to the World Summit
for Social Development will be followed up during the
special session to review the achievement of the goals
of the World Summit for Children, to be held next year.
We expect that session effectively to address the issue
of the protection of children, who are always the first
among the civilian population to suffer in time of war.
The Principality also wishes to contribute to
development at the public level as well as in terms of
the non-governmental organizations, which are very
active in Monaco, where they receive the strong
support of all those who feel themselves morally
obligated to contribute to the activities undertaken in a
spirit of solidarity by a country that allows them to lead
a privileged life. We expect from the upcoming
Conference on the fight against poverty in the least
developed countries, to be held next May, and in
particular from the 10-year review of the outcome of
the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development, known as Rio + 10, a new impetus for
international cooperation in these areas so vital to the
future of humanity, in which progress is currently
lagging.
It goes without saying that environmental issues,
including in particular those relating to the marine
environment, have always been priority concerns for
Monaco, situated as it is on the Mediterranean coast.
We will continue to follow up on these activities and to
take initiatives along the lines of those we have been
promoting.
I can only reaffirm the role that the Principality
plays in all relevant forums to intensify the struggle
against the severe scourges of our times, such as
terrorism, trafficking in drugs and in human beings,
and the illegal financial flows which they create or
sustain.
Let me conclude by expressing the hope that I
have been able to provide a clearer view of the
situation in present-day Monaco, a situation of
contrasts. Monaco is one of the smallest countries in
the world, but at the same time one of the most highly
developed. It is an anachronism for those with an
unrealistic or prejudiced view, but its economic
structures reflect great modernity and dynamism. Its
image may be identified with play and leisure, but the
fact is that it creates jobs well beyond its borders. It is
viewed as a curiosity, yet it remains an acknowledged
sovereign State, as proved by its participation in the
principal international organizations and by the fact
that its voice is heard in areas where its contribution
deserves to be taken into account.
I could continue that list of contradictions, but I
think those are sufficient to provide a key to what His
Serene Highness Prince Rainier III said when he
opened the fabulous new Grimaldi Forum  a
conference and cultural centre in Monaco  in
summarizing the inspiration that has always sustained
his dynasty and the Principality over the centuries:
`One does not need a great territory to have great
dreams, or a great number of people to make
them come true."
MCO,1996,"﻿It is a
great pleasure for me, at this fifty-first session of the
General Assembly, to congratulate you on your election.
Your wealth of experience in international affairs, your
professional skills and your great diplomatic qualities are,
for me and my country, a guarantee that our work will be
successful. I would like to include in these very sincere
congratulations the other officers of the Assembly, whom
we have just elected. I wish them all every success in the
important and delicate tasks that lie ahead.
I should also like express our gratitude to and
admiration for the President of the fiftieth session of the
General Assembly, whose very successful term of office
has just come to an end. He did sterling work in ensuring
the prestige of the numerous and highly symbolic events
that marked the fiftieth anniversary of this Organization.
He gave great impetus to the extensive discussions within
the General Assembly on strengthening the United
Nations system and on the question of equitable
representation on the and increase in the membership of
the Security Council and other matters related to the
Council. Suggestions were made by the delegation of
Monaco with regard, notably, to the increase in the
number of permanent and non-permanent members of the
Council. They appear in annex 11 of the report of the
working group established to that end.
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank
the Secretary-General for his efforts to make our
Organization less costly and more effective. In a
particularly difficult political and economic situation, he
has never failed in the mission we entrusted to him five
years ago.
I referred just now to the difficulties of our times.
These are major difficulties and often seem
insurmountable, at least in the short term.
Many factors, sometimes very different but broadly
connected, exacerbate these difficulties. The major world
conferences on population and development, on social
development and on human settlements clearly brought
these factors to light.
If the sustainable and harmonious development we
aspire to is to apply to all human beings, we must also try
to preserve the resources of our planet so that future
generations do not find themselves totally destitute one
day. In a vital area for us, the Principality of Monaco has
been striving for nearly a century to promote the
preservation of oceans and seas and the priceless
resources they provide, through studies and research, but
also by taking specific national and international
initiatives. Accordingly, Monaco ratified the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and intends in
7


1998 to play an active role, commensurate with our size
and resources, during the International Year of the Ocean.
The General Assembly, five years after the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development,
wisely decided pursuant to resolution 50/113 to hold a
special session to consider and review the implementation
of Agenda 21. This will be an extremely important session.
We hope it will give us an opportunity to reinforce the
objectives spelt out at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.
The Principality of Monaco is pleased to host next
year’s seventh session of the High-Level Advisory Board
on Sustainable Development and then the International
Whaling Commission.
My country is thus showing our interest in the
international cooperation which is essential if we are to
address the confrontation between legitimate economic
development and protection of the environment and the
non-renewal natural resources of our planet.
Other major concerns which seriously impede
development remain. No continent is spared the tensions
felt around the world, which pose a serious threat.
Our Organization does not always have the means
needed to face up to these challenges and to the most
alarming situations. Nevertheless, we welcomed the
adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,
which is finally open for signature and which I will have
the honour to sign during this session on behalf of the
Principality of Monaco.


Might I refer here to the major role played by the
International Atomic Energy Agency which so ably and so
carefully monitors compliance with the safeguards
agreements concluded in the framework of the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which the
Principality of Monaco has ratified. Together with this, the
Agency very scrupulously seeks to apply, sometimes in
very delicate circumstances, the decisions of the Security
Council in this respect. Its responsibilities in the field of
disarmament are very substantial. Monaco is therefore
particularly proud to be the home of the Marine
Environment Laboratory, which functions with the
assistance of the United Nations Environment Programme
and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.
Furthermore, my delegation has been following very closely
the follow-up to resolution 50/75, of which our
Principality was one of the sponsors, and which the
General Assembly adopted on 12 December 1995.
The strengthening of security and cooperation in the
Mediterranean is of concern to us, as it is of concern to
neighbouring friendly countries on both sides of the Sea.
The Secretary-General has embarked on valuable
consultations in this respect, and for this we thank him
very sincerely.
When wars break out, once the weapons have fallen
silent, the painful aftermath remains, including millions of
landmines, which have a devastating, extremely deadly
effect, scattered in fields and under roads and have a
massive impact on civilian populations, primarily on
children. At the human level, the proliferation of these
devices causes serious, often incurable, mutilation and
major material damage. The Security Council’s 15 August
1996 discussions on demining in the context of peace-
keeping operations highlighted, if there were any need to
do so, the importance that the United Nations and the
major Powers attach to this question. His Serene
Highness, the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, my father, is
no less mindful of this. He has requested his Government
to provide regular financial assistance to demining
operations by contributing to the fund set up by the
United Nations for that purpose. Without offering an
immediate, complete solution, a moratorium — or, even
better, cessation — on the production and export of these
anti-personnel landmines would give us some hope.
This year saw the holding of the twenty-sixth
Olympic Games. Men and women from 197 countries and
territories, from very different backgrounds, came together
and tested their strength. They fought peacefully and, with
mutual respect and esteem, created imperishable bonds. I
was there as Chairman of the Monaco Olympic
Committee and as a member of the International Olympic
Committee, and I can attest to the unique spirit which
every four years brings together the world’s best athletes.
I wish to pay tribute to them. They are an irreplaceable
example for the young people of our nations. I think it is
right, here, to echo the appeal made by many
organizations that there be more women representing their
countries at the Olympic Games, and that traditions,
however worthy of respect, do not become discrimination
against women in the area of sport.
The cooperation that has grown up between the
United Nations and the Olympic Movement, which share
lofty universal principles and values, gives me great hope.
8


Our General Assembly regularly bolsters this cooperation
in its resolutions, and I hope that the same will happen this
year.
These athletic, dynamic and devoted young people
often work as volunteers for the United Nations and non-
governmental humanitarian organizations, and they deserve
our heartfelt gratitude.
I wish too to recall the World Programme of Action
for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond, adopted last year
by the General Assembly in resolution 50/81. We must take
account of its recommendations in every area, particularly
those of education, employment, health, the environment,
and ensuring full, effective participation of women in the
life of society and in the decision-making process.
The Principality of Monaco, which ratified the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Racial Discrimination and is a party to the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, is very concerned by
contemporary forms of racism and marginalization. We
encourage the efforts of the United Nations and the Special
Rapporteur on this subject.
We are also seriously alarmed by the development and
scale of child prostitution and the trade in young girls and
boys. An important initiative was taken last August by a
non-governmental organization, End Child Prostitution in
Asian Tourism, with the assistance of the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Sweden.
We must all heed the work of the world Congress
against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. I am
sure that the conclusions and recommendations of this
Congress, in the form of an agenda for action, will raise
our consciousness about the seriousness of the situation by
encouraging States to adopt the necessary national and
international measures.
By participating in the Congress, Monaco showed its
commitment to a world policy to combat the commercial
sexual exploitation of children. On the national level, this
is taking the form of unreserved support for humanitarian
associations and non-governmental organizations that are
active in this area and, in particular for their efforts to
sensitize others to this scourge, to prevent it and to
rehabilitate its victims. We are also introducing a legislative
initiative which should lead to a change in Monaco’s penal
code before the end of the year, with the introduction a new
crime: the sexual exploitation of children for the satisfaction
of the vices of others, whether these events occur in the
Principality of Monaco or outside our national territory.
Once this law is in effect, any person apprehended in
Monaco who has committed, in any place whatsoever,
acts that can be qualified as crimes or attacks against
decency or morality according to the laws of Monaco as
regards minors, can be prosecuted and tried.
I would add that the international community must
also think about strengthening international legal
protections in this area, in so far as existing texts,
including the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child,
particularly its articles 19 and 21, often remain
inoperative because they are difficult to apply.
Similarly, the 1926 Slavery Convention, the 1956
Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery,
and the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the
Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the
Prostitution of Others, which are very general in scope,
do not provide sufficiently effective, speedy recourse in
this particular area, where emergency action is necessary.
The strengthening of this protection in the form of
a multilateral instrument, for instance, could permit
judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for
the illicit commerce in children and their commercial
sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against
humanity, that is, that they be considered indefensible
under the Convention on the Non-applicability of
Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against
Humanity of 26 November 1968. Article 1 of that
Convention should thus be modified appropriately. Like
those stipulated in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, these acts
should not meet with a refusal to extradite. The law, and
international law, should be fully capable of protecting
these weak, destitute beings, while leaving no chance of
impunity for the perpetrators of these vile crimes.
In addition to strengthening legal protections, we
should also give some thought to the steps needed to
rehabilitate these young victims, as broadly emphasized
by the Stockholm Congress; without such rehabilitation,
that these children would fall back into prostitution circles
might prove inevitable.
Although some of the behaviours I have just
mentioned are intolerable and unacceptable, I wish now
to speak of the United Nations Year for Tolerance, which
ended in December 1995. Adopted in December 1993
thanks to a welcome initiative by the General Conference
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, and supported by a unanimous resolution of
9


the General Assembly, this manifestation of faith in
humankind, concluded with a Declaration and Plan of
Action that were designed to inspire not only high-level
politicians, but each of us in our daily lives.
In keeping with General Assembly resolution 49/213,
the Follow-Up Plan of Action for the United Nations Year
for Tolerance, accompanied by the Declaration of Principles
that preceded it and that inspires it (A/51/201), is before
this year’s session of the General Assembly. It invites us to
make a common effort to combat political and social
factors which often seem to be at the origin of intolerance
and hatred.
This invitation should receive the proper response, for
it could contribute to providing solutions to the tensions
that persist in the world, some of which, as we know, are
extremely disquieting.
Throughout history, the most important moments of
progress have certainly occurred during periods of real and
profound tolerance. Such tolerance favoured thought, the
arts, the sciences, the sharing of knowledge and values. It
built civilizations and enabled them to draw together and
mutually enrich one another in an exceptional way.
While many today are convinced that history probably
has no meaning, it remains none the less a fragile and
precious commodity, largely fashioned by the commitments
and the will of man.
On 8 January next year we shall commemorate the
seven-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of my
family’s dynasty in Monaco. In celebration of that event,
many cultural and artistic events, some on an international
scale, will take place throughout 1997. This will be our way
of paying a tribute to our past as well as of expressing our
confidence and faith in the future and destiny, not only of
our country, but of mankind.
On that note, I should like to conclude my statement
by thanking the President very much for having allowed me
to speak.










"
MCO,2019,"We would be either presumptuous or dangerously indifferent if we did not assess the impact of the renewed call from the world’s youth about our climate emergency and failed to respond to it with speed, ambition and effectiveness. Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande is well aware of our young people’s importance. The African continent, which he is honouring as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, is the only region in the world whose population under the age of 24 continues to grow. Those young people behind the movements in support of our planet are quite rightly driven by an unprecedented anxiety about the future but above all by an immense hopefulness that should push us to make real change. We must reflect those messages in our policies if we are to respond bravely and with determination.
This year’s Climate Action Summit, which was so well organized by the Secretary-General with the support of Special Envoy Luis Alfonso de Alba, enabled us to showcase the mobilization and creativity of all the actors in our societies. For its part, the Principality is firmly committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 and plans to take the steps needed to achieve that ambition. Our energy transition mission, established in 2016, is redoubling its efforts to accelerate the transition of multiple stakeholders to run on low carbon. Our national energy transition pact will enable everyone — individuals, public and private companies and associations — to commit to becoming actors and partners in making the changes in our lifestyles that must inevitably result.
Only proactive policies will enable us to grapple with the strains on a country that welcomes more than twice its permanent population on a daily basis. In that regard, we are paying particular attention to aligning policies combating climate change and preserving air quality in order to safeguard health, in line with the commitments under the BreatheLife campaign, coordinated by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. Monaco has also joined the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action with a view to making progress in implementing economic and financial policies supporting the global transition to a low-carbon economy. Beyond measures at the national level, Monaco will be taking its full share of responsibility with regard to the collective goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually between now and 2025 for climate action in developing countries. In that regard, the Principality will participate in the first replenishment of the Green Climate Fund.
Monaco is committed to the nature-based solutions coalition with a view to maximizing the major contribution of natural capital to climate action. Climate change and the collapse of biodiversity, far from being isolated crises, are two alarming symptoms of the anthropocene age that we must respond to together. Based on that belief, the Government of Monaco is committed to attaching the same degree of importance to the preservation of biodiversity and the fight against climate change. Starting in 2020, for example, Monaco will be increasing its international funding aimed at preserving and regenerating biodiversity, while mitigating and promoting adaptation to climate change and improving the resilience of vulnerable populations.
The protection of forests and the essential services that they do for human communities, especially as carbon sinks, is of course fundamental. That is why the recent devastating fires in various parts of the world constitute a real ecological disaster. It will also be crucial to preserve the seas and oceans, whose key role in climate balance and extreme vulnerability to global warming we have been made aware of thanks to advances in science. In that regard, the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was the subject of a meeting concluded yesterday in Monaco, is damning. It is therefore up to us to take full account of its conclusions and of the recommendations made by many scientists so that we can translate those findings into the political decisions we will take next year in the areas of climate change, conservation and the sustainable use of oceans and biological diversity. Monaco has historically chosen to support science. The fact is that it is essential that the policies we implement be based on the most reliable scientific knowledge possible.
The commitment of so many of us to standing with the Secretary-General is testament to our support for his leadership and our recognition of his unwavering commitment to the multilateralism that the United Nations embodies. Nevertheless, international institutions and civil servants, however dedicated, cannot be held responsible for our inaction or failure.
We are aware of the many challenges that we face, and we know perfectly well that we will either deal with them together or succumb to them individually. Our common future depends on regularly adapting our guiding light, which is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Summit, which today launched an ambitious “decade of action”, lists ten priority areas that we should focus our efforts on. In the Global Sustainable Development Report, scientists speak of a tipping point or critical point for certain ecosystems, which means that we are reaching a level of degradation from which there can be no return to a normally functioning state. The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019, from the Secretary-General, and the Global Sustainable Development Report on the first cycle of SDG implementation, by the group of independent experts mandated by Member States, show that progress has been made in some key areas and that there have been promising developments, in particular the reduction of extreme poverty and a decline in the under-five mortality rate.
However, despite those advances, the reports urge us to redouble our efforts urgently. The natural environment is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Sea levels are rising, ocean acidification is accelerating, the last four years have been the hottest on record and 1 million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. At the same time, the number of people suffering from hunger continues to increase, more than half of the world’s population still lacks essential health services and too many children still lack adequate reading and mathematics skills. That is why the direction I have set for my Government since 2005 combines the vision of a world that prioritizes progress and well-being with the implementation of activities to protect the environment, fight for peace, respect justice and sustainable development, defend the underprivileged and work for a more just and harmonious planet. In this way, every part of the Principality’s Government action must adhere to the requirements of sustainable development. Economic progress must foster social progress while also respecting the environment.
The transition to a more sustainable way of life cannot be achieved without creating a more inclusive and fulfilling society for individuals. Women and girls therefore cannot be excluded from those efforts at a time when we are preparing to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In October, in order to reaffirm its commitment to the defence of women’s interests, my Government established a committee for the promotion and protection of women’s rights. It is a deplorable fact that in today’s world, our women, mothers and daughters are among the first victims of the wars and conflicts that continue to rage and are also particularly vulnerable when populations are forcibly displaced.
The fourth industrial revolution is under way. Artificial intelligence brings hope, but also poses risks that must be comprehensively addressed. The digital revolution is leading us into a movement of creative destruction that is neither linear nor predetermined. We hold the keys to it and it is our responsibility to shape the way forward. We must seize the opportunities that arise, but we must also guard against threats caused by our societies’ uncontrolled development, particularly where security and worsening inequality are concerned. The speed, scale and scope of the changes that have already begun should encourage us to lay the foundations for dialogue.
In the face of those challenges, Monaco has reached a technological turning point and launched a digital transformation that is both an economic necessity and a way to honour our commitments in the area of sustainable development. The launch in April of our Extended Monaco programme has put us on the road to a digital transition of unprecedented scale, while giving particular emphasis to the concepts of responsibility and sustainability. As part of its digital transition strategy, the Government therefore plans to use the assets that technological innovation offers in the fields of health, education and the economy, as well as to make Monaco a model for smart cities.
In an interconnected world, the spirit of good neighbourliness mentioned in the Charter of the United Nations and to which “nations large and small” must adhere should take on special meaning. That is the path to follow in a world where we have all become each other’s neighbours and where notions of time and space have become more relative. We owe our capacity to transcend adversity and establish norms for managing our interdependencies to the multilateral institutions that we have created, and the sovereignty of all of our States will emerge the stronger from that.
As we follow one another onto this rostrum, we are beginning the countdown to the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations in 2020. This Hall has seen so many debates, confrontations, promises and advances, and yet so many dashed hopes as well. But we are still here, because when we adopted the Charter, we decided to pool our efforts to achieve these goals — saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, proclaiming our faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and promoting better standards of life in larger freedom.
Over the past three decades in this General Assembly Hall we have travelled together along a path that is certainly strewn with pitfalls, but we have nevertheless taken important steps. We have adopted, amended and corrected many texts and created mechanisms, processes and frameworks for addressing new challenges. From disarmament to human rights, from the preservation of the environment to major pandemics and from the fight against terrorism to social development, our strength has always resided in our unity and ability to compromise when we are dealing with the best interests of the peoples for whom our Organization was founded. Paradigm shifts and the funding that they require are beyond the reach of individual Member States, but they are not impossible if we strive for them in solidarity in the service of humankind.
"
MCO,1995,"Allow me first of all, and with particular gratitude, to
extend to the President’s predecessor, His Excellency Mr.
Amara Essy, our warmest compliments for the care and
discipline he displayed during his presidency of the forty-
ninth session of the General Assembly. Our compliments
also go to the other officers who worked with him.
Allow me also to extend the sincere congratulations
of the delegation of the Principality of Monaco to the new
Bureau that has just been elected and say how pleased we
are to see this fiftieth session of the General Assembly
under the esteemed authority of Mr. Freitas do Amaral.

The country he represents, a country that is open to
the world, tolerant, accessible, culturally rich and enriched
by the cultures it has encountered throughout its history,
deserved to be given this recognition. Our General
Assembly decided to give it and we are deeply gratified.
His personality and great political experience at the national
and international levels, has recognized abilities and
dynamism should all help to ensure the success of this
important session.
Its importance is first of all symbolic. Since man
invented calendars, anniversaries have been occasions for
celebration and rejoicing, and, as many speakers have said
before me, for taking stock.
Since its inception, our Organization has lived through
highly complex political, economic, social and cultural
events and phenomena which make any appraisal difficult.
It position and role have grown constantly and gained in
importance over the past fifty years. The expectations that
people have for it and the hopes they place in it can be
measured by the depth of the disappointment and bitterness
that can be seen in cases of failure or difficulty.
Has the United Nations not always tried to respond to
the constant and often conflicting appeals made to it? Its
responses are inspired by the fundamental values that
prevailed when the Charter was drafted in 1945. Let us not
forget that our States, by joining the United Nations,
recognized the universality of these values. We must remain
true to them and provide assistance whenever they are
endangered. Recent events, still fresh in all our minds, have
reminded us that these values have not always been
respected and that faith in fundamental human rights, in the
dignity and worth of the human person, and in the equal
rights of men and women and of nations, large and small,
has not always been shared. And so, at this fiftieth
anniversary of our Organization, these values must be
recalled forcefully and with conviction at every opportunity
so that these same values can be the inspiration for each of
our resolutions, and every text we adopt.
Above and beyond the States that we represent and
their legitimate political interests, it is individuals — often
vulnerable and adversely affected by poverty or war —
who must be the recipients of international cooperation. It
is our duty to live up to their expectations.
When we look at the situation in this way, whether in
terms of the Organization as a whole or in terms of certain
of its organs, such as the Security Council, it becomes clear
that there is a constant effort at adapting on the part of the
international community, and a need — widely
anticipated — to make our Organization more
performance-oriented, more representative and closer to
the concerns of its membership.
We have followed with interest the work of the
various Working Groups set up to that end. We have
participated, and we have made suggestions, inter alia,
with regard to equitable representation within the Security
Council and an increase in its membership.
In recent years, there has been a significant increase
in the membership of the United Nations, and today it
includes all, or almost all, nations of the Earth. And so it
would seem quite normal that its decision-making bodies,
including the Security Council, should reflect this new
reality. As the famous French writer and philosopher Paul
Valéry wisely said, we have reached the stage when the
end of the world is beginning. For this reason, we must
now redouble our efforts and heighten our vigilance so
that our Organization may be able to respond to this
universality, in a relevant manner and in all its diversity
and richness.
Along with reforming its decision-making bodies, the
United Nations must continue to improve its functioning
and restructure its operations. Major efforts have been
made. We would thank the Secretary-General for this, and
we would also thank the members of the Secretariat.
Improving the functioning of this Organization must
take account of the need to strengthen its multilingual
nature. Every staff member should know at least the two
working languages of the Organization. Using just one
language deprives the Organization of a rich resource. If
we wish to really enhance the effectiveness of the
Secretariat, we should first of all concentrate seriously on
improving the language abilities of staff members so that
they have a truly international culture and dimension.
As can be seen from our history, the people of
Monaco and the Government of our Principality, like all
peace-loving peoples, follow very closely all initiatives to
reduce armaments and transform the arms race — which
has gone on too long — into a race towards disarmament.
Let us hope that with the end of the cold war, this
approach will be strengthened and that despite technical
and financial problems, disarmament processes will not
only continue but speed up.
We must more than ever ensure that respect for
international treaties and agreements and for international
14


law shall replace the balance of terror, and that the law thus
serve justice.
It is in this spirit that we wholeheartedly welcome the
indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons. Our Principality was in favour of this
extension, and so once again we would thank the parties to
the Treaty for this courageous decision, which was inspired
by trust and hope. We welcome the initiative of the Powers
that have already entered into a commitment — which had
been expected for next fall — to ban, over the short term,
all nuclear-weapon tests. This is a major advance.
Our Government also welcomes particularly the
decisions taken at the meeting, currently under way in
Vienna, aimed at establishing a moratorium on the
production of anti-personnel land-mines. We trust that this
example will be followed widely.
Since joining the United Nations, the Principality of
Monaco has been co-sponsoring the resolution on assistance
in mine clearance. By contributing financially to the
voluntary fund created for that purpose, my country’s
highest authorities wished to become involved, in a
concrete way, in the implementation of that resolution. The
international community, quite rightly, was shocked by the
death and mutilation caused by these mines, which afflict
mainly civilian populations, and children in particular.
Our delegation would hope that significant progress
could be made in strengthening security and cooperation in
the region of the Mediterranean, in the spirit of resolution
49/81, which we co-sponsored and which was adopted on
15 December 1994. Our Principality hopes that we will
always be involved in all the initiatives relating to the
Mediterranean countries.
We are also ready to support all initiatives in favour
of international cooperation relating to the peaceful uses of
outer space and those intended to develop, in collaboration
with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, education and information programmes in
support of disarmament. Making young people aware of
this issue is a fundamental guarantee for peace in the years
to come.
While general and complete disarmament, no doubt
still far off, may today seem utopian to some, nevertheless
that goal must remain our ambition. For when weapons
awaken, their might and their destructive power are
limitless.
This year, conflicts have been particularly
devastating. Wars of another age have become the wars
of our age, attacking, brutally and without distinction,
men, women, children and defenceless old people.
The Government of the Principality is thus resolutely
in favour of strengthening preventive diplomacy on the
part of the United Nations. We would thank the
Secretary-General for the initiatives he has already taken
to promote the settlement of many disputes and to avoid
the eruption or continuation of conflicts. The “Supplement
to An Agenda for Peace'” is an irreplaceable source of
ideas, suggestions and wise solutions.
It is no longer tolerable that the Blue Helmets be
mistreated, humiliated, taken hostage and used as human
shields with no means of defending themselves. Those
men and women are no doubt ready to sacrifice their life,
but not their dignity.
This is a particularly appropriate time to stress —
because recently the Organization has been criticized very
sharply — how much it has contributed to the successful
solution of disputes, which have sometimes been very
difficult ones, and how much courage has been needed to
take certain decisions and to carry out certain operations
successfully.
The hopes for peace coming out of the Middle East
and Bosnia and Herzegovina represent a significant
recognition of the courage that has been demonstrated,
and they are an invitation to us to continue to persevere
and to be optimistic. The report of the Secretary-General
on the work of the Organization reminds us, in a very
timely way, of this, mentioning the 24 operations
currently under way in the areas of preventive diplomacy,
the restoration and maintenance of peace, and the four
major operations, which he describes as multifaceted.
Coordination within the Secretariat between the three
Departments involved in peace-keeping operations
responds to current needs and concerns, a fact we note
with great satisfaction.
When diplomacy, at the end of its tether, cannot
prevail and conflict erupts, then barbarism triumphs. No
law of war, no humanitarian law, can control it. The most
vulnerable human beings and those without weapons are
not spared. The only way to help them is by humanitarian
assistance.
15


In conditions that are always very difficult and
sometimes dangerous, many humanitarian operations have
been conducted in a most admirable way in the last few
months. Men and women have lost their lives, and I pay
tribute to their suffering and to their memory. I would pay
tribute in particular to the “blue helmets”, the soldiers of
peace, and to the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees and to UNICEF, as well as to the many non-
governmental organizations, some well-known, some less
well-known, that have all worked tirelessly, constantly and
with determination to protect, feed and provide medical and
health care to populations that are adrift, assaulted by
ruthless armed conflict.
This year, the Principality of Monaco contributed a
large percentage of its public efforts to financial
contributions in the humanitarian and social fields. We will
continue to do so, hoping that the action that is taken to
this end can be completed as the conflicts themselves cease.
We would like to lend our support, and this is in the
spirit of the suggestions made by the Chairman of the
delegation of Monaco, His Serene Highness, Crown Prince
Albert, to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session,
to the thinking now under way on the strengthening of the
coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance provided
by the United Nations.
The international Tribunals created on the initiative of
the United Nations designed to prosecute those responsible
for crimes against international humanitarian law in the
territories of the former Yugoslavia and of Rwanda must be
quickly established and enabled to function so as not to
disappoint the hopes that have been placed in them.
The idea of an international criminal court also
deserves consideration and support.
Humanitarian actions and respect for international
humanitarian law are corollaries in a period of armed
conflict to the struggle being waged by the United Nations
to ensure general and universal respect for human rights.
Since the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights
in Vienna, significant progress seems to be under way.
With human and material resources that are far from
sufficient to meet actual needs, the Centre for Human
Rights, thanks to the commitment and the extensive
experience of its staff, is successfully continuing its work.
The increase in the number and the quality of the
consultants and the technical assistance provided plays a
major role in ensuring that human rights are no longer
just a concept, but become a reality. The presence in
many countries of specialists working in varied areas,
such as training, education, legislative reform and public
information is one way of anchoring human rights and,
thereby, the state of law in society on a day-to-day basis.
The dispatch of observers to certain troubled regions
of the world today is also an excellent initiative. We hope
that it will continue, because it strengthens the moral
presence of the United Nations. The creation of the post
of High Commissioner is also in keeping with this
approach, and we would encourage his actions.
International cooperation in favour of the respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms, which is one of
the basic vocations of this Organization, is being
strengthened thereby.
Rights that are applied to certain categories but
which should remain universal — as the Fourth World
Conference on Women in Beijing has just rightly recalled
by describing women’s rights as being inseparable from
human rights — must be recognized and strengthened in
their application.
The implementation of international Conventions
relating to those rights is an essential element in this
strengthening process. The committees set up pursuant to
those instruments are the focus of this process and of the
arrangements made to implement it. They must be given
the means to act and to react.
The Government of Monaco is particularly involved
in the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of
the Child of 20 November 1989, and that of the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Racial Discrimination of 21 December 1965, to which
the Principality of Monaco has just become a party.
The human condition in the twenty-first century will
depend to a large extent not only on respect for civil and
political rights, but also on the promotion of economic,
social and cultural rights.
It is in terms of human rights that we have to look
at development, a point made in the 1993 Vienna
Declaration.
The recent World Summit for Social Development
in Copenhagen also adopted this approach. My
16


Government noted with interest the conclusions of the
Fourth World Conference on Women, which has just ended
in Beijing.
All of this leads us to think, as does the Secretary-
General, that development must first of all be recognized as
a primary task of our age.
The fundamental objective must be to improve the
standards of living of people throughout the world,
including the developed countries, where an increasingly
large part of the population is excluded from the benefits of
progress.
The satisfaction of basic needs and the elimination of
poverty, hunger, sickness and ignorance must be goals that
we constantly seek to attain, using all available means.
The Government of Monaco devotes a major part of
its resources to social assistance, particularly for women
and children, those who are most in need.
The celebration in 1996 of the International Year for
the Eradication of Poverty will be an excellent occasion for
strengthening the implementation of these
recommendations.
Recent work on the “Agenda for Development” has
attracted close attention. For the Principality of Monaco,
development must above all be sustainable and based on
balanced economic exchange and trade, harmonious
regional integration and careful protection of the
environment.
The implementation of Agenda 21, the Conventions
and resolutions adopted at Rio de Janeiro in support of the
environment and development, is in our view a priority.
The General Assembly has decided that 1998 shall be
the Year of the Oceans. The people of Monaco, like all
peoples that love the sea, are eagerly awaiting this event.
Through our history, our traditions and our economy
Monaco, like many other countries in the world, depends to
a large extent on the sea and its resources, whether these be
living, commercial, tourist or industrial.
Protecting this valuable element of the environment
against all kinds of thoughtless pollution and over-
exploitation is a major concern. Enough must be done at
the regional and international levels to protect it. In the
Mediterranean, the Principality of Monaco is doing what it
can, along with its closest neighbours France and Italy,
within the framework of international agreements with
practical and specific goals.
The year 1998 must be an opportunity for us to
become more aware and to launch new multidisciplinary
and well-planned programmes so that the next century
will not see an irreversible worsening of the state of the
seas and oceans. In this connection, we are glad that the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is
willing to act as the secretariat for the world programme
of action to protect the marine environment against land-
based pollution. The Government of Monaco will be
interested in this programme and any other action to
eliminate organic pollution from the marine environment.
The Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is involved
in the international initiative to protect coral reefs. We
have organized an exhibition to make the public more
aware of the need to protect coral, which is particularly
sensitive to all forms of pollution and which, to develop,
requires a healthy and protected environment. The UNEP
programme on regional seas deserves encouragement.
I cannot conclude my statement without mentioning
the very serious financial crisis that the Organization is
going through. The measures taken by the Secretary-
General are mere palliatives. If all Member States were to
live up to their commitments there would be no problem;
there would be no need for working groups or committees
of experts, which, after all, involve additional expenditure
for the Organization.
In conclusion, I should like to repeat something that
was said by a famous politician: the United Nations, like
nations, shapes its own future; nothing good comes to it
by chance; those that serve it are those that develop their
inner strength.
"
MCO,2008,"Allow me at the outset to convey to the President my 
congratulations on his election and to acknowledge, 
through him, the Latin American and Caribbean States 
that made his presidency of the General Assembly 
possible. Let me assure him and the other Assembly 
officers that my delegation will support them 
throughout the sixty-third session of the General 
Assembly.  
 I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his 
resolute action in favour of peace and reiterate to him 
our sincere and full support. 
 Finally, allow me to state what a great honour it 
is for me to take the floor today for the first time at the 
rostrum of this prestigious Hall. 
 The great and deeply missed poet Aimé Césaire 
said: “A civilization that is unable to resolve the 
problems that beset it is a decadent civilization.” We 
know what the sufferings of our civilization are. We 
have identified the solutions needed to treat them. The 
issue at stake here is implementing those solutions. 
 Eight years ago, in this very Hall, all the States 
Members of the United Nations adopted the 
Millennium Declaration, the decisive tool in the fight 
against poverty, to promote peace, security and human 
rights, and to ensure a sustainable environment. It 
provided the framework for eight precise goals 
accompanied by clear time frames — the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). 
 My message today is a simple one. The 
international community cannot afford to fail in the 
implementation of the MDGs, in spite of the threefold 
food, energy and environmental crisis seriously 
affecting the whole planet. To achieve the goals that we 
set ourselves at the dawn of the new millennium, we 
will have to step up our efforts and pursue concerted 
action in the only universal forum we have — the 
United Nations. 
 Eight years ago, we drew up together a scorecard 
with quantified goals and defined the steps to be taken 
to reduce poverty, fight hunger in the world and 
combat pandemics. Eight years ago, the situation was 
very alarming; we could not have imagined that things 
were to get worse.  
 Since then, we have been faced with the energy 
crisis and increasingly scarce resources, the food crisis 
and soaring prices of basic food products, and the 
  
 
08-53129 18 
 
climate crisis resulting from the impact of human 
activities on the environment. Adding to that already 
very dark picture, we must now face the financial 
crisis, whose repercussions continue to be felt and 
whose full impact is yet to be seen.  
 Each country is suffering the consequences of 
those crises in a different way depending on its 
geography, its economy and its commercial and 
financial market exposure; and each country is 
attempting to face them with its own means. The 
Principality of Monaco, within its capabilities, has 
chosen to fight two of those crises — the food crisis 
and the climate crisis — with the resources at its 
disposal. 
 Much of the progress achieved in recent years in 
helping those populations suffering from hunger and 
malnutrition has been erased by soaring increases in 
the price of basic foodstuffs. Two billion human beings 
are seriously at risk even as world cereal production 
has reached a record high in 2008. The African 
continent, and in particular sub-Saharan Africa, with 
60 per cent of its population affected by the crisis, is 
once again the worst-affected continent. 
 It remains nonetheless undeniable that the right to 
food is among the basic human rights. During the 
High-Level Conference in Rome last June, the 
international community adopted the Declaration on 
World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate 
Change and Bioenergy. Monaco fully supports the 
measures advocated in the Declaration and joins the 
call for the establishment of a world partnership 
centred on the High-Level Task Force on the Global 
Food Security Crisis. 
 A year ago, His Serene Highness Prince Albert II 
announced here his decision to substantially increase 
Monaco’s official development assistance (ODA). The 
Principality’s Government is sparing no effort to reach 
the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of its gross national 
income by 2015 by increasing our ODA by 25 per cent 
every year and focusing its actions on the least 
developed countries.  
 In 2008, 22 countries, mainly located around the 
Mediterranean basin and in sub-Saharan Africa, have 
benefited from a development partnership with the 
Principality. In addition to that bilateral cooperation, 
Monaco contributes on a regular basis to large-scale 
programmes of the United Nations system, such as the 
World Food Programme, the United Nations Children’s 
Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization, the 
United Nations Development Programme and the 
United Nations Population Fund, whose expertise and 
structures facilitate the greatest assistance to the 
poorest populations. 
 Moreover, climate change and the imbalances it 
creates have a direct impact on the sustainability of our 
actions for development. The climate crisis, 
desertification and the shortage of water resources have 
exacerbated the food crisis.  
 Antoine de Saint Exupéry said: “We do not 
inherit the Earth from our parents; we borrow it from 
our children.” Pursuing that analogy, the international 
community is not allocating sufficient funds to repay 
that loan. 
 Under the leadership of our Head of State and in 
collaboration with the Prince Albert II Foundation, the 
Government has committed itself actively in the 
International Polar Year to raise awareness among as 
many people as possible of the consequences of global 
warming. In that regard, the Arctic ice cap deserves all 
our attention since it serves as both an indicator of the 
consequences of global warming and as a vector of 
climate change through its gradual disappearance. 
 Last year, when adopting the resolution on oceans 
and the law of the sea, member States expressed their 
deep concern over the vulnerability of the environment 
and the fragility of ecosystems of the polar regions, 
particularly the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic ice cap. At 
Monaco’s initiative, the decision on sustainable 
development of the Arctic region was adopted at the 
tenth special session of the Governing Council of the 
United Nations Environment Programme, which was 
held in the Principality in February 2008. 
 We will pursue our commitment to that cause in 
the coming months when Monaco will host meetings 
on the Arctic: the first in November 2008, organized by 
the French presidency of the European Union, and the 
second organized by UNESCO early next year. I would 
also note that the Principality has solemnly confirmed 
its interest in the polar regions by acceding to the 
Antarctic Treaty on 31 May, and that His Serene 
Highness Prince Albert II will join a scientific mission 
to Antarctica in January. 
 Notwithstanding the obstacles we have 
encountered on the road since 2000, we have to stay on 
track. Indeed, let us roll up our sleeves, consult each 
 
 
19 08-53129 
 
other and work together to multiply our forces and 
create genuine synergy. 
 I would like to reiterate here the deep 
commitment of the Principality of Monaco to the 
United Nations, the only genuinely universal 
organization, which has human rights and the 
promotion of dialogue among nations at its very core. 
The Charter of the United Nations guarantees the 
sovereign equality of States and the rule of law. 
Monaco has been a Member of the United Nations for 
15 years. Since joining, our small Principality has 
covered a lot of ground on the international scene, 
becoming a member of the Council of Europe in 2004 
and, very recently, joining the Union for the 
Mediterranean. 
 Without the United Nations, it is doubtful that 
human rights would have acquired their universal 
status, which today is indisputable. This year and next, 
many anniversaries remind us yet again of the essential 
role of the United Nations: the sixtieth anniversary of 
the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the 
Declaration of the Rights of the Child, and the 
twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
 The world has changed since the San Francisco 
Conference. Today, our task is to modernize the United 
Nations and ensure that its institutions adequately 
reflect our democratic principles and new geopolitical 
balances. As His Serene Highness Prince Albert II 
stated here last year, Monaco supports the expansion of 
the Security Council. 
 Only the combined efforts of all partners will 
allow us to make real progress in the fight against 
poverty, to promote health care and education, improve 
access to water and protect the environment. As 
indicated in the June 2008 recommendations of the 
MDG Africa Steering Group, the primary responsibility 
for achieving the MDGs remains with African 
Governments, which have shown tremendous 
leadership in recent years and launched ambitious 
programmes to attract the financial support of their 
development partners. 
 We have seen real progress since 2000, in 
particular in the area of health. Monaco, for its part, 
contributes to various WHO and UNICEF programmes 
and participates in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, sickle 
cell anaemia, tuberculosis and malaria. However, the 
greatest national efforts, if made on an individual basis 
and without coordination, will not be enough to fight 
the scourges that affect our planet, and the African 
continent in particular. 
 The evaluation of ODA policies, the sharing of 
good practices, the coordination of development 
assistance, partnership with the private sector, 
microfinance and the pursuit of alternative revenue 
sources are all instruments that, together with the 
priority to be given to the central role of women in the 
economy, will enable us to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals in the next seven years. "
MCO,2003,"﻿Let
me first congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the
presidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General
Assembly. Your election is welcome testimony of the
equal sovereignty of States, a principle to which the
delegation of the Principality of Monaco attaches
particular importance. I assure you and the members of
12
 
the Bureau of our support for your high mission at the
service of the international community.
I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General:
all are aware of his tireless efforts to promote with
courage and lucidity the ideals our Organization
embodies as it faces the challenges of our time. The
tragic circumstances surrounding the heinous attack
perpetrated in Baghdad last month call for us to pay
special tribute to all United Nations personnel and
salute with respect and sorrow the memory of those,
including Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his
companions, who by sacrificing their lives, have
demonstrated the strength and grandeur of commitment
to the values that only our Organization can
legitimately embody.
When it joined the United Nations ten years ago,
the Principality of Monaco pledged to fully abide by
the obligations incumbent on all Member States and to
participate, according to our means, in the promotion
of the values that bring us together. We are all the more
attached to that commitment because it is particularly
important for small States such as Monaco that all are
bound by the same rules in their international conduct
and that all enjoy equal dignity and the equal right to
respect.
Of course, there is a considerable and at times
glaring divergence between the ambitions we collectively
espouse and the actual situations we observe around us,
which unfortunately afflict so many among us.
Assuredly, it would be pointless to ignore the profound
differences that may exist between States in terms of
both their characteristics and their influence in
international affairs. But it is essential that we have a
place, a forum in which we are all compelled to judge our
actions and conduct by the principles that are supposed to
guide our actions and in which we are compelled to
examine our conscience — in short, a place where we, as
members of the international community, are held
accountable to the collective demands of that community.
That is why it is so important that we strive to
make the Organization more effective so that respect
for our principles and purposes prevails over the
seeming ease of self-justification and so that a
collective approach based on dialogue prevails over
unilateral action. As a question of principle and as a
result of reasoning, the Principality of Monaco
therefore supports all initiatives aimed at strengthening
our collective mechanisms, in particular those
undertaken by the Secretary-General pursuant to the
Millennium Declaration as presented at the opening of
the present session.
Accordingly, the Principality of Monaco attaches
particular importance to the effective implementation
of the General Assembly resolution on the follow-up to
outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and
summits in the economic and social fields. Indeed,
what purpose would be served by these enormous
gatherings in which all participants vie to demonstrate
their magnanimity and generosity if the resulting
commitments are not followed up on or lack the means
to monitor their implementation? The authority of the
United Nations and the confidence placed in it would
be diminished, even as the Organization has
considerably expanded the range of its activities in
order to effectively tackle the problems of our time,
acting from the global perspective of its own ongoing
responsibility to ensure peace, security and
development. Would civil society, which today is
present in all the debates that involve it, not feel
frustrated and seek to take the lead on its own terms,
creating an environment of confrontation?
While participating in the many activities pursued
within the Organization, a small country such as the
Principality of Monaco must reasonably assess the size
of the contribution it is able to make to the action of
the international community. Thus, we have focused
our efforts in the areas of sustainable development and
humanitarian action because we feel that our acquired
experience enables us, despite our human and material
limitations, to make a useful contribution since we can
count on very dynamic Monegasque non-governmental
organizations, which benefit from particularly generous
local support. I am happy to convey our appreciation to
those organizations.
Monaco’s priority areas are education, health, the
protection of children, development assistance and
environmental protection. Its activities have resulted in
numerous achievements in the field, particularly in
Africa, where our aid has doubled following the
adoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development. Monaco has also achieved much in the
Mediterranean region. All Monaco’s initiatives are
complemented by our active participation in the forums
where those various situations are addressed.
The Principality of Monaco focuses on concrete
projects such as schools, occupational training centres,
13
 
healthcare centres, investments in local communities to
promote economic activity in village communities
through micro-credit programmes. All those projects
are aimed at directly improving the living conditions of
their beneficiaries.
In the area of the environment, in which the
Principality has long distinguished itself, especially in
the protection of the marine environment since one of
Monaco’s sovereigns, Prince Albert I, helped found the
study of oceanography in the late nineteenth century.
Our experience has led to us being chosen to
participate in the next Governing Council of the United
Nations Environment Programme. The Principality of
Monaco has also been the source of many initiatives
related both to protecting its immediate environment,
the Mediterranean Sea, and to monitoring pollution and
preserving biodiversity elsewhere, with a long-term
perspective of support for sustainable development.
Resolutely committed to participating in the
efforts of the international community to rise to the
most recent challenges with which it has been
confronted, Monaco has ratified the twelve main
international instruments relating to terrorism, putting
into place appropriate administrative structures.
Furthermore, it is the first State to ratify the United
Nations Convention against Transnational Organized
Crime, which will enter into force in the next few days,
on 29 September. It is also preparing to host, next
month, the Fifth International Summit on Transnational
Crime, organized by the United Nations and the
Council of Europe, which will bring together
representatives of Governments and the private sector.
In the same spirit, the Principality works with all the
relevant institutions to fight drugs and human
trafficking and the illegal financial flows they engender
or sustain.
Need I also reaffirm the obvious commitment to
peace and security of a country as sensitive to its
environment as Monaco, even if, having no armed
forces, it is unable to participate in collective actions
under the flag of the United Nations? It is in the
humanitarian field that Monaco consistently makes its
contribution by assisting civilian populations, victims
of combat and the upheavals and atrocities that too
often today characterize armed conflicts, as can be seen
particularly in Africa. In a symbolic solidarity, the
Principality celebrates the International Day of Peace
on 21 September and associates itself with the Olympic
Truce, given Monaco’s involvement in the Olympic
movement as symbolized in the long-standing
participation of Crown Prince Albert in the International
Olympic Committee. We thus welcome the inclusion of a
new item on the agenda of this session, entitled
“International Year of Sport and Physical Education”,
whose goal is to highlight what has always been our
motivation, the outstanding role of sport in developing
relations between peoples by promoting mutual
understanding and intercultural dialogue, factors that
contribute to both peace and development.
As I conclude this statement, I hope I have
succeeded in communicating the profound attachment of
the Principality of Monaco to the world Organization that
it joined 10 years ago at His Serene Highness Prince
Rainier III’s initiative. He was convinced that his
country would thereby gain a most effective
international profile, protection in an uncertain world
and an opportunity to usefully demonstrate its
solidarity. Since Monaco is naturally open to the
outside world, it has easily found its place among you.
Our Principality is grateful for what the United
Nations has given it and is striving in return and to the
extent of its capacity to help the Organization achieve
its objectives with the conviction that what the
international community needs are reliable Member
States. And reliability is not a question of size but of
will. It is this will that inspires and guides us.




"
MCO,2012,"﻿The
Secretary-General has shared with us the priorities that
he plans to implement during the sixty-seventh session
of the General Assembly. His warning concerning
the multiplicity of new threats and his clear-sighted
recognition of their interconnections should inspire and
guide our work.
The maintenance of international peace and
security — need it be said again — are the very
essence of the mission of our Organization. What
do we see before us? Crises and threats to peace and
security are multiplying and are often even mutually
reinforcing, along with the endangerment of human
rights. What global vision do we share of the challenges
that confront our planet, its States and its peoples? By
bearing in mind that it is our mission and urgent need
to uphold our vision, which calls on us to support the
five priorities of the programme of action that have
been drawn up for the next five years and submitted
to us by the Secretary-General. Since he has invited
us to so, we wish to underline the need to prioritize
the strengthening of the United Nations system as well
as the development of partnerships in all areas of its
activity.
The President rightly sought to focus the general
debate of this session on the subject of the peaceful
settlement of international situations and disputes. This
historic debate, launched at the beginning of the week
by the General Assembly, has shown that respect for the
rule of law, at both the national and the international
levels, is indispensable for the establishment of
responsible societies that are able to promote  cooperation and ensure the well-being of their citizens.
Recent history leads us to take a serious look at the
current difficulties confronting the world. While last
year we welcomed the magnificent spark of democracy
that was kindled in the Arab world, it is intolerable now
that minority factions and extremists are threatening
the hopes and dampening the expectations of people
who aspire to live in liberty.
The Government of the Principality of Monaco
echoes those who have condemned the acts of violence
perpetrated both by the authorities and by opposition
groups in the Syrian Arab Republic, where the
situation only continues to deteriorate. I would also
like to convey my full support for the efforts made by
the International Committee of the Red Cross and its
resolve in seeking to ensure that humanitarian needs
are met. Clearly, that is involves ensuring that each and
every one respect the rule of international humanitarian
law as the minimum requirement for meeting the basic,
elementary moral standards of our peoples, standards
that do not, unfortunately, seem to be shared by all.
We are equally concerned by the recent events in
the Sahel region, including in Mali, which are growing
worse. The Principality of Monaco, which is involved in
various humanitarian efforts in the region, supports all
such actions by the international community, given the
urgency and gravity of the situation. We will support
a strategy established by the United Nations that can
address the issues of security, governance, development,
human rights and humanitarian aspects. The values that
we are committed to uphold in adopting the Charter of
the United Nations are based on our common humanity
and on the recognition of our differences, which are at
the very core of our humanity.
Allow me, in that regard, to pay tribute to all those
who have been committed to serving those values on
the ground, often paying with their lives. They seek to
uphold the aims and principles that bring us together
here in this forum. Our authorities have resolutely
condemned all attacks perpetrated against diplomatic
and consular missions and personnel. We must all
ensure the obligation of guaranteeing their protection
in all circumstances.
At a time when the world is facing worrying
developments, the theme that the President has selected
for this session of the General Assembly merits the
unanimous support of all in our community. Aware of
the challenges, I would like to take the opportunity to
commend Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the General
Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, on his election
and to assure the Assembly of my delegation’s full
support.
More than ever before, we need to resort to the
peaceful settlement of our disputes and seek to prevent
rather than react to events. In the 1950s, Secretary-
General Dag Hammarskjöld urged us to be mindful of
the need to respond at an early stage to crises in order
to avoid the outbreak of disputes between parties or the
conf lagration of a dispute into an open conflict, or in
the event that a conflict does break out, to ensure that
it can be contained.
We have been caught unaware and so many ongoing
problems in the year 2012 have gone unsolved. We have
been largely successful in ensuring that international
law prevails over the right to wage war. However, the
involvement of our Organization in conflict prevention
still falls quite short, as avowals and statements of intent
on their own are insufficient. It is therefore our common
duty to strengthen understanding, tolerance and mutual
respect. As was recalled by the Secretary-General here
on 13 September, as well as by his predecessor, one of
the strongest factors for conflict prevention, and thus
for the inculcation of an authentic culture of peace, is
education. That kind of prevention is aimed at enrolling
the young generations to whom we owe a future.
The challenges are manifold. Among them, I would
single out the economic and financial crisis, which has
affected the overwhelming majority of our States since
2008. We can overcome the crisis, creating employment
while protecting our environmental heritage. But
in order to do so, we need an ambitious long-term
vision, and that is why, in spite of the budget cuts,
the crisis has compelled us to realize that we cannot
afford to lose sight of the Millennium Development
Goals — elimination of poverty and hunger; education;
child and maternal health; and combatting pandemics,
including HIV/AIDS and malaria, which sap humankind
of its strength — which must remain uppermost on our
agenda.
The upcoming deadline must encourage us to do
still more to intensify our efforts in order to ensure their
achievement. In 2015, we will adopt a new programme
of action, based on the results achieved and on the new
challenges to be met.
In his address to the United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development, His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of the Principality of Monaco welcomed the
fact that we are progressing towards a shared definition
of sustainable development goals. Those goals will
frame our actions at the international, national and local
levels, and in turn, that will make the implementation of
our commitments more effective and more transparent.
One of those objectives should emphasize
the sustainable development of oceans and on the
importance of the blue economy.
That objective should concern all sectors that
depend on ocean resources and maritime areas. It
is urgent that that objective be comprehensive and
sustainable so that those sectors can continue to benefit
from economic, social and environmental services.
Accordingly, our delegation will support all initiatives
seeking to improve the coordination and effectiveness
of the United Nations work in the oceans. Indeed, we
believe that that is the right path to follow in order to
ultimately ensure the sustainable use and management
of the oceans and thereby their conservation.
The fate of future generations lies in our hands.
For that reason, we are obliged to ensure that the Doha
Climate Change Conference is a success. It is therefore
crucial that we reach agreement on the establishment
of a second period of commitments under the Kyoto
Protocol. We therefore commit ourselves to working
positively and effectively in the negotiations on reaching
a new global post-2020 climate agreement, taking into
account the needs of the most vulnerable.
His Serene Highness Prince Albert II welcomes
the celebration next year of the twentieth anniversary
of Monaco’s joining the United Nations as a Member
State. In that connection, Monaco wishes to express
its resolve to contribute to the further strengthening of
our Organization to the extent that a small State can
do so. Members may rest assured that the Principality
welcomes the Assembly’s two-fold intention of
further involving itself in the field of development
and establishing an advisory framework that seeks to
enhance the cooperation between the General Assembly
and international financial institutions.
On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the
Forum of Small States, of which Monaco is a member,
and also in its capacity as a member of the Global
Governance Group, the Principality intends to play its
full role in the work of those bodies. The magnitude of
the challenges and crises that we all face have shown
that the size of a State is not the deciding factor when
it comes to resolving such problems. Rather, it is solely
our ability to work together and cooperate that enables
us to respond to everyday needs and that will lead us on
the path towards international peace and security.

MCO,2015,"The successful outcome of the United Nations Summit to adopt the post-2015 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) coincided with the seventieth anniversary of the Organization and reflected the joint resolve to face up to, over the 15 years, the many obstacles and global challenges that impede sustainable development for all. The Heads of State and
Government adopted a historic agreement whose goals aim at eradicating poverty and restoring dignity to each individual so that all might enjoy their freedoms and rights.
The twenty-first century should meet the expectations of peoples for higher social justice and for shared prosperity and a healthy environment that is respectful of future generations, as was quite rightly underlined by His Holiness Pope Francis in front of the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.3). The proliferation of conflicts and crises and the millions of victims caught up in their destructive wake further strengthen our determination to pursue the transformation of current models, whose ambition is to match the challenges we are facing.
The continuing tragedy in Syria and the barbaric means used by extremist groups, which is being propagated in West Africa and the Middle East, fill us with horror. Such groups indiscriminately target religious minorities, civilians, women and children — the latter always being the most common victims. In addition, the international community cannot remain indifferent in the face of the destruction of our common human heritage, such as the temples in Palmyra. They are a symbol of the Middle East as the cradle of a culture for thousands of years. We therefore strongly support the Secretary-General’s “Rights Up Front” initiative and his endeavour to establish a plan of action on preventing violent extremism.
In that regard, I should like to remind members that Monaco co-sponsored Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), on foreign terrorist fighters and combating violent extremism. The Principality of Monaco is already implementing Security Council resolutions on freezing assets and imposing economic sanctions on people who might be connected to terrorist networks. Furthermore, Monaco is currently reinforcing its legal framework in the area of national security. We are also actively participating in the fight against money laundering for funds coming from illicit activities.
We are aware of the importance of cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. Monaco therefore continues to support a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine. We did so over the course of the last three months of 2014, when we chaired the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Forum for Security Co-operation,
15-29701 15/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
and we continue to do so today by supporting the work of the OSCE Observer Mission.
The past few months have seen flows of migrants in Europe that have been unprecedented since the Second World War. The dire humanitarian consequences require a coordinated multilateral approach. The European Union plan in that regard provides a timely response. The principle of the responsibility to protect was endorsed by His Serene Highness Prince Albert 10 years ago from this high rostrum; it must be the basis for our collective action in the face of genocide, ethnic cleansing and other crimes against humanity.
The primary responsibility bestowed by the charter of the Security Council to maintain international peace and security brings me to commend the courageous initiative taken by France and Mexico in calling for the voluntary and collective suspension of the right of veto by its five permanent members when dealing with mass atrocities. I take this opportunity today to announce Monaco’s official support for that initiative, as well as the one presented by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group to develop a code of conduct that would apply to all Member States.
Let me also express our gratitude to those who promote such specific and ethical measures to reinforce the effectiveness of the Security Council and make its decisions more convincing in the face of public opinion. All of the efforts made to promote better representation in the Security Council merit support. My Government welcomes the recent developments in the intergovernmental negotiation process.
In one month’s time we will celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, when the results of the global study on its implementation will be released. Unfortunately, we are too sadly familiar with the devastating consequences of conflicts for women, who are often the first victims when they are, however, not responsible for such conflicts. Along with children, they also represent the majority of refugees and displaced persons. Convinced of the importance of the full and active participation of women on an equal footing in preventing conflicts and peacefully resolving them, as well as in peacebuilding and peacekeeping, we therefore call for the implementation of specific measures.
The issues to be tackled by the first humanitarian summit proposed by the Secretary-General are of the
utmost importance, and all the more given that, in addition to the human tragedy I have just mentioned, we must also address the issues of the victims of climate change, natural disasters and a health crisis. In that regard, the international community will have to define a new humanitarian deployment framework that can respond to the growing and complex needs, can support financing and can complement operations by providing planning and long-term development.
Regional consultations have already highlighted the concerns of various stakeholders. They will allow for adequate responses to be found not only that meet the complexity of the humanitarian crises but also the specificity of each of the crises. Monaco has participated actively in that preparatory work, in line with our commitment in the context of our international cooperation policy and as part of the major mobilization by our non-governmental organizations and the Monegasque Red Cross.
The magnitude of the Ebola virus epidemic served once again to demonstrate the absolute need to build effective sustainable health systems that can face up to extraordinary situations. In that regard, Monaco has already expressed its support for the reform that has been begun by the World Health Organization.
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda was developed to facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its 17 Goals and 169 targets. The aim is to find an effective way to transform our lifestyles. The technology facilitation mechanism launched during that summit reflects a spirit of collaboration among all development stakeholders for the benefit of developing countries. It also bears witness to the will of the international community to build capacity in a specific manner.
However, those efforts will not be successful without an ambitious and legally binding universal agreement that allows us to fight climate change effectively and to move towards low-carbon and resilient societies and economies. The Principality of Monaco is convinced that the twenty-first Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris, will be part of that trend and will help us to achieve a global climate agreement. Such an agreement is a sine qua non condition for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

That is why Prince Albert has committed the Principality to reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, as compared with 1990 levels. He has also renewed his commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050. In setting those objectives, the Principality demonstrates its willingness to take a full part in the collective effort needed to face one of humankind’s biggest challenges. Despite its low emissions footprint, Monaco will continue to promote innovative means of transportation and consumption, as well as urban planning that is as green as possible.
We cannot talk about the climate without talking about the issue of the oceans, which play a central role in regulating the world’s climate. That is the reason that has led the Principality of Monaco to support the 2015 ocean and climate platform of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. Monaco is pleased to see that this is an integral part of the sustainable development programme, which strengthens the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea — a veritable constitution of the oceans. That is the sense behind the personal commitment of Prince Albert and also of his leadership of his Government’s actions in favour of healthy and productive oceans and seas. To ensure the implementation of this agenda, Monaco proposes to convene conferences every three years from 2017 onwards.
For small island developing States the ocean is not just a source of economic and social benefit, it is also an integral part of their identity. For that reason, Monaco has increased its cooperation for climate change adaptation and for the preservation of biodiversity as well as for access to water, the development of sustainable tourism and for capacity-building.
In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Assembly that for several years now Monaco has proposed increasing the protection of marine mammals from the growing threat caused by human beings. We hope that this proposal will be included in the omnibus draft resolution on oceans at this current session.
In 70 years, the United Nations has worked to honour the goals bestowed on it by the Charter. It has repeatedly adapted itself to emerging challenges that have transformed the world since its creation. The political will that prevailed during the United Nations Summit to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals
has served to encourage us to further strengthen the Organization by giving it the means to pursue its noble mandate. We have thus reaffirmed the legitimacy of the values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in today’s world. The Principality of Monaco remains more than ever convinced that this is necessary, and it will continue to make its modest but resolute contribution to building a better world while respecting our differences.
"
MCO,2004,"It is with great pleasure that I congratulate
you, Sir, on your unanimous election to preside over
the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, an
election that offers Africa its tenth presidency. The
Gabonese Republic thus has received from the
international community the recognition it deserves
and the French-speaking countries are delighted to see
one of our own guiding our debates. Be assured that
the delegation of Monaco, which I am leading, will
fully support you in your noble mission in the service
of peace and development. I would also like to hail the
Secretary-General for his courage and his unwavering
commitment to peace.
A long time ago, the Organization began a
process of thinking through the reforms that are
required to improve its functioning. In that connection,
I would like to congratulate the outgoing President of
the Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, on his work during the
fifty-eighth session; his perseverance made possible
the adoption of new measures to revitalize the work of
the General Assembly. While welcoming that progress,
we know that we must continue along that path.
Dedication to democracy and to the rule of law,
unswerving confidence in the virtues of multilateralism
and respect for our differences allow us to move
forward in a spirit of harmony and to continue to adapt
the Organization to meet the challenges of our time. It
is vital that the Organization be provided with the
means to better respond to the expectations of the
peoples of the world.
This is why the Principality supports initiatives
aimed at improving the Organizationís methods of
work and, in particular, those regarding Security
Council reform. Enlargement of the Council, in both
permanent and non-permanent seats, will strengthen its
capacity to contribute to the essential objectives of the
maintenance of peace by providing more equitable
representation of the diverse regions that compose the
international community.
The fifteenth International AIDS Conference,
held in Thailand last July, once again highlighted the
devastation caused by this terrible pandemic as well as
its disastrous social consequences. However, the
Conference also demonstrated that when international
organizations, Governments and civil society agree to
work together, we can fight this scourge more
effectively. In that struggle, the role of women is
crucial. In my country, Her Serene Highness Princess
Stephanie, my sister, created and chairs the Fight AIDS
Monaco association that gives moral and material
support to AIDS patients and their families while
promoting information and prevention programmes.
For my part, I have expressed the wish that all of
the Principality's school children participate in marking a
23

world day for children orphaned by AIDS, to show
their solidarity with these vulnerable children whose
number could reach 100 million by the year 2010.
Once again this year, my country has been
contributing to the Global Fund to fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria, which was created following
the twenty-sixth special session of the General
Assembly, the first to be devoted to a disease. We have
been providing regular support for the activities of the
Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS) since its creation, and I am pleased to
announce that the Principality has decided to
strengthen its financial cooperation with the
Programme. We hope that the creation within UNAIDS
of the Programme Acceleration Fund will allow us to
meet specific needs defined by the recipient States
themselves. In effect, we are convinced of the necessity
for States to strengthen, on the one hand, their
capacities in terms of basic social services and
adequate sanitation facilities and on the other hand, to
pursue public awareness and information campaigns.
Upon the initiative of His Serene Highness the
Sovereign Prince, my father, the Principality of
Monaco has always expressed its solidarity to the most
underdeveloped populations. We share the concerns of
world leaders regarding the adverse impact that the
persistence of extreme poverty is having on
international security.
We shall therefore consider most carefully the
elaboration of a new global partnership designed to
eliminate hunger and poverty and to advance economic
development and social justice, as a continuation to the
commitments undertaken at the Millennium Summit
and during the Monterrey Conference.
Terrorism, unfortunately, has become a daily
reality, as is attested to by, among others, the tragedy
that took place in Beslan, which is repugnant to all of
us. Our determination to fight it must remain unshaken
and that is why we welcome the establishment of an
executive directorate of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee. In that domain, international cooperation is
an essential element for effective action. No State,
regardless of its size, can be a weak link that might
endanger the efforts we are conducting together.
Therefore, the Principality intends to play its role
in the battle which our Organization is waging against
terrorism. Thus, Monaco has become a party to all of the
twelve conventions designed to eradicate international
terrorism and has adopted, as domestic legislation,
appropriate measures for their implementation.
But the battle against terrorism also requires that
we act irreproachably in terms of our respect for
human rights. Accordingly, the Principality is making
every effort to guarantee them on its territory; hence
Monacoís forthcoming accession to the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women.
The number of refugees and displaced persons
who are displaced within their own countries continues
to increase, and our response to the unbearable
suffering of those human beings cannot be limited to
our moral indignation. As in any urgent and complex
emergency situation, civilians and the most vulnerable
among them are the targets of harm and the worst types
of abuse. The humanitarian disaster which continues to
take place under our very eyes in Darfur has shown,
once again, how limited we are in our capacity to
enforce respect for human rights and for international
humanitarian law.
In response to the appeal launched by the Office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) during the special session of the
General Assembly on children in 2002, the authorities
of Monaco decided to earmark their traditional
contribution to UNHCR towards primary education for
refugee children. We hope to provide those children,
whose world has been brutally shattered overnight, a
substitute for their traditional educational environment,
by allowing them to escape, albeit a little, those terrible
conditions of daily life dominated by promiscuity and
the anguish of having forever lost their homes.
Championing the interests of the child has always
been one of our major concerns. To build a world fit
for children, in keeping with the commitments
undertaken during the May 2002 special session on
children, the World Association of Childrenís Friends,
presided over by my sister, Her Royal Highness the
Princess of Hanover, organized in the Principality in
April 2003, a round table on that subject.
Unfortunately, the need is becoming clearer each day,
to strengthen the area of international law designed to
guarantee the rights of children and to assure that those
laws are more effectively applied.
Thus, do not those particularly heinous crimes
require an exceptionally strong response? Do we not
need to ensure that the most serious violations of the
24

rights of children do not fall under a statute of
limitations and do we not need to extend the powers of
the national jurisdictions by providing them with
universal competence in that area?
The Principality of Monaco urges you to give
thought to this, in other words, to plan for the adoption
of a legal instrument which will make it possible here,
to react against the impunity which continues to
prevail, concerning the enrolment of child soldiers, the
sexual exploitation of children and the despicable trade
of which they are victims - to mention only the most
revolting of those crimes.
The debate held last June in the Security Council
served to reaffirm the timely nature of such
considerations. By abolishing the statute of limitations
for those horrendous crimes, we would be
strengthening their prevention, as well as fulfilling our
duty to honour the memory of the victims. By
expanding the competences of our national
jurisdictions so that borders no longer serve to limit
our actions, we will be better able to cope with the
development of the transnational organized crime
network which defies our States and the legal order
they are trying to establish.
I am fully aware that this essentially moral
struggle - to ensure respect for the rights of the
child - gives rise, given the present state of
international law, to numerous legal difficulties. But is
it not our duty to act when that legislation is no longer
adapted to meet the challenges of our time, at a time
when the international community is clearly closing its
unified ranks, to put an end to those practices which
are abhorrent to all of us?
Let us be courageous and foresighted in
championing the most noble cause that exists - the
defence of innocents. Let us respond to the appeal of
Albert Einstein made so long ago that - there will be
no progress in this world as long as there are unhappy
children."
MCO,2011,"Allow 
me at the outset to warmly congratulate Mr. Al-Nasser 
on his election as President of the General Assembly 
and to assure him of the support of my delegation 
throughout the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.  
 The Secretary-General, whom I heartily 
congratulate on his unanimous reappointment, 
introduced, at the opening of the general debate, the 
priorities that he intends to implement during his 
second term in office. His vision, which will guide our 
endeavours and our deliberations during this period of 
instability and uncertainty, sets forth the parameters for 
a new form of global governance that will need to, on 
the one hand, respond to the challenges that we face 
and to the aspirations of our peoples and, on the other, 
take into consideration the new realities of our time. 
 Among these new imperatives of the twenty-first 
century, sustainable development and the building of a 
safer world require a more responsible approach on the 
part of all our Governments and the renewal of our 
unwavering support for the Organization, whose 
crucial role in the prevention of conflicts, human rights 
violations and natural disasters needs to be 
strengthened and supported. 
 It was Mr. Al-Nasser’s clear-sighted initiative to 
make the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes 
by peaceful means the theme of the general debate. Our 
community now has a new Member — the Republic of 
South Sudan — following a peace process that was 
welcomed by all. Since the beginning of the year, we 
have seen a great impetus towards freedom and 
democracy among thousands of women and men across 
the Arab world. The Arab Spring has highlighted once 
again the universal nature of the norms and values of 
the Organization. Justice, democracy, human dignity, 
equality and freedom have led to renewed hope among 
peoples for too long repressed. Today we face a great 
challenge: not to disappoint them. 
 The Government of the Principality reiterates its 
support for and its solidarity with all who fight for 
respect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, 
and in that regard is hopeful that a just, lasting and 
comprehensive settlement will enable the State of 
Israel and a viable, sovereign and democratic 
Palestinian State to live side by side in peace and 
security. 
 The past year has been rich in challenges for our 
Organization. We have had to face great natural and 
humanitarian disasters, emergency situations caused by 
people and the fallout of the economic crisis. Each 
time we turn to this Organization to safeguard 
humanity’s shared assets, such as the environment, 
health and peace.  
  
 
11-51390 12 
 
 We also turn to the United Nations to protect our 
collective security. The deadly attack a few weeks ago 
on the United Nations offices in Abuja, the capital of 
Nigeria, cruelly reminded us of the innumerable risks 
faced by United Nations personnel across the world — 
in Côte d’Ivoire, Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur, the Sudan, 
everywhere where the United Nations has saved lives 
or upheld rights. They sometimes pay the ultimate 
price.  
 But our Organization has limited resources and 
cannot always deal with the multiplication of conflicts. 
We must therefore focus above all on the prevention of 
conflicts. What is a better prevention measure than 
development? Last year from this same rostrum His 
Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco reiterated 
the Principality’s commitment to achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (see 
A/65/PV.4). Monaco seeks to be a responsible, reliable 
and supportive partner, and its priorities continue to be 
improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable 
people. 
 I wish to underscore the essential role of women 
in the prevention and settlement of conflicts and in 
peacebuilding. Women and girls must be at the centre 
of our development strategies. It is now an established 
fact that a society that guarantees equality between 
women and men and promotes the economic 
independence of women is a more prosperous society. 
If we wish women to be able to realize their potential 
in the economic sector, we need to get rid of obstacles 
such as discriminatory regulations. We need to ensure 
that women have equal access to economic resources, 
particularly to land, credit, science and technology, 
vocational training, information, communication and 
markets.  
 In this regard, the Principality of Monaco wishes 
to reiterate its support for UN-Women and its 
Executive Director, Ms. Michelle Bachelet. 
 It is our shared responsibility to show our 
commitment in the crucial gathering of 2012 — the 
twentieth anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit — and 
to create a solid basis for the comprehensive 
development of a green economy.  
 We are seeking to develop sources of renewable 
energy, more environmentally friendly and healthy. But 
in the short term, we are not in a position to abandon 
nuclear energy or oil. As we have learned so painfully 
through the Fukushima accident, we do not know 
whether one day it will be possible to fully control all 
the risks involved in nuclear energy. We thus continue 
to burn hydrocarbons, sending their emissions into the 
atmosphere. These pitfalls pose a great danger to our 
collective security.  
 It is time to put an end to the ideological debates 
and the divides that separate us and that delay our 
efforts to implement a green economy. 
 The Secretary-General proposed that we establish 
a new generation of development objectives to succeed 
the MDGs after 2015. The Principality of Monaco 
supports that initiative, which aims to encourage the 
international community to set ambitious goals and to 
provide the wherewithal to achieve them.  
 As part of its contribution to that endeavour, 
Prince Albert II wanted Monaco to contribute actively 
to the preparatory work for the United Nations 
Conference on Sustainable Development by organizing 
in the Principality, from 28 to 30 November 2011, a 
meeting of high-level experts on the sustainable 
management of oceans. His Serene Highness would 
like to see the international community place the seas 
and oceans at the top of the political agenda at the 
forthcoming Earth Summit.  
 In spite of the development of a legal framework 
to govern activities in the oceans, the negative impacts 
of human activities on oceans and seas are becoming 
increasingly visible. Marine pollution and 
unsustainable practices in the exploitation of marine 
resources are continuing to endanger marine 
ecosystems, to the detriment of future generations. 
Climate change has had a significant impact on oceans, 
leading to the phenomena of acidification, rising sea 
levels and coral bleaching. Sustainable management of 
the oceans is an essential pillar of the green economy. 
 Stronger prevention measures, at the service of 
all Member States, both developed and developing, 
will enable the Organization to carry out its role with 
greater efficiency and flexibility. That requires the 
strengthening of its institutions, taking greater account 
of the role of the General Assembly, balanced reform 
of the Security Council, increasing cooperation with 
regional organizations, enhanced interaction with civil 
society and private sector partnerships.  
 I wish to hail the leadership and political courage 
of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the 
General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, who 
 
 
13 11-51390 
 
endeavoured to impose the moral force of the United 
Nations before the eyes of the entire world.  
 The Principality of Monaco will not fail to work 
for the improvement of global governance that our 
community hopes and prays for. We share the 
conviction regarding the immense importance of the 
universal values upheld and defended by the 
Organization, values to which future Members must 
adhere, as we have done. "
MCO,1999,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate you warmly,
Mr. President, on your well-deserved election and to assure
you of the delegation of Monaco's full cooperation in
assisting you in the discharge of your lofty mandate. Your
role in your country's exemplary struggle for independence
and for the dignity of the Namibian people are deeply
meaningful for us.
I should like also to thank the members of the General
Assembly for entrusting to my country one of the vice-
presidencies of this fifty-fourth session, at the same time as
Monaco is commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the
accession of His Most Serene Highness Prince Rainier
III — my father. I wish to assure the Assembly that the
delegation of Monaco will strive to be worthy of this
honour and to work closely with the other members of the
Bureau — whom I congratulate on their election — and the
members of the Assembly, to ensure that this session, the
last of the century, produces effective, concrete and
tangible results.
I avail myself of this opportunity to thank also
Mr. Didier Opertti, President of the fifty-third session of
the General Assembly, for his dedication and accessibility
and for the competence and diplomatic skill with which
he guided our work.
I should like also to congratulate and warmly
welcome the three new States Members of the United
Nations — the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of
Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga. The Government and
people of Monaco are particularly pleased to greet these
three countries of the Pacific, with which we share a
number of concerns about the protection of the oceans
and seas. We assure them of our readiness to enter into
and develop a solid and fruitful cooperation with them.
Finally, I should like most sincerely to express my
satisfaction, as many have already done from this rostrum,
at the resumption of the peace process in the Middle East
and the immense hopes to which it has given rise.
Since the general debate of the previous session,
many distressing events have unfolded, some of which
have had serious consequences that will last for years.
The conflict in Kosovo, with the thousands of refugees
and the massive suffering that it caused, was one of the
most obvious. The whole of the United Nations system
was mobilized, in a way that has certainly never happened
before, to assemble the resources required to come to the
aid of the populations in distress. The armed intervention
and the decisive role played by the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague, brought
to bear in defence of the principles of humanity and
human rights, seem to foreshadow a strengthened
determination on the part of the international community
to enforce respect for the fundamental values of justice
and human dignity that inspired the San Francisco
Charter.
We offer our sincere encouragement to the United
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo as it
strives, despite the major difficulties in its way, to
implement the provisions of Security Council resolution
1244 (1999). We wish courage, perseverance and success
to the men and women responsible for carrying out that
noble mandate of ensuring security, extinguishing the
flames of hate and restoring good-neighbourly relations
among the communities.
12


I should also like to emphasize the crucial role played
by the United Nations in holding the election on self-
determination in East Timor and in the protection operation
that our Organization has recently launched to come to the
aid of the civilian population there. We are following
developments on the ground extremely carefully, and we
hope that implementation of Security Council resolution
1264 (1999) will proceed without hindrance or delay.
In this context, we should recall the very enlightening
debate held by the Security Council on 12 February on the
issue of the protection of civilians in armed conflict, during
which the subject of internal conflicts, which have now
become more numerous than those between States, was
discussed at length. It was recalled that such conflicts fall
under the purview of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, whose
fiftieth anniversary we have just commemorated, especially
the provisions of the Fourth Convention. Article 3, which
is common to all four instruments, imposes rules of conduct
that are binding on the High-Contracting Parties, whatever
the circumstances and nature of the conflict. That article
categorically prohibits any kind of attack on the life and
physical and moral integrity of the person, as well as the
passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions
without previous judgement or indispensable judicial
guarantees.
On 16 and 17 September, a further debate took place
in the Security Council on the same issue, the positive
result of which was the adoption of resolution 1265 (1999),
which makes considerable demands on both States and the
international community as a whole. It stresses in particular
that it is incumbent on States to put and end to impunity
and to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes
against humanity and serious violations of international
humanitarian law. The Principality of Monaco unreservedly
endorses these recommendations, which we consider to be
extremely important.
We have very high hopes for the establishment of the
International Criminal Court as a means of better
preventing war crimes and crimes against humanity. The
Principality of Monaco was one of the first signatories of
the Statute, which was adopted last year.
In Kosovo, in East Timor and in conflicts that are
often forgotten or that receive no recognition, particularly
those in Africa, it is the weakest and the most vulnerable,
particularly children, who suffer most. With the tenth
anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights
of the Child taking place on 20 November, it is up to us
now more than ever to see to it that children, in peace as
well as in war, are strictly protected from all forms of
violence and subjugation. Following on from the
presidential statement of June 1998, Security Council
resolution 1261 (1999), adopted on 25 August, will, we
hope, make a decisive contribution to resolving the
distressing problem of the fate of children in times of
armed conflict.
My country, which is committed to that end, has
been host to a number of international non-governmental
organizations dedicated to the protection of children.
These associations are working hand in hand with the
United Nations specialized agencies. For its part, the
Principality of Monaco is actively contributing on a
regular basis to steps taken to improve the lot of the most
disadvantaged children.
Just as children need to be protected, women, too,
deserve the keenest attention from the international
community. Many forms of discrimination and
injustice — indeed, cruelty — including genital
mutilation, which is the cause of much pain and
humiliation, are still too often tolerated. They represent a
number of obstacles to women's achieving their full
potential. In a report recently submitted to the
Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of
Human Rights, a non-governmental organization known
for its competence and precision denounced the
unacceptable treatment still being endured by women in
many countries, be they young girls, wives or mothers. I
should like in this connection to emphasize the high
regard in which we held the high-level debate that took
place in the Economic and Social Council last July on the
role of jobs and work in the elimination of poverty,
emphasizing in particular the advancement of women.
Women's access to jobs, as well as to education and
professional training, has been widely encouraged. It is
one of the areas of concern of the Government of the
Principality, which is taking specific measures in the
social and educational fields in order to deal with the
issue. Respect for equality between men and women in
daily life, as well as in the development of their
professional careers, in both public and private sectors, is
essential if we are to improve the situation of women and
combat the precariousness and poverty that often affect
them much more than men. We are particularly aware of
that. The substantial involvement of women in political
and economic decision-making can also contribute to
ensuring greater social justice, while stimulating and
balancing the economy. The authorities of my country are
convinced of this and are striving to take steps to adjust
13


and complete the legislation of Monaco so as to ensure that
in every respect it is in conformity with the requirements of
the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women, so that Monaco
can soon become a party to that essential instrument.
Because of the complexity and irrevocably globalized
nature of today's economy, it has become necessary, now
more than ever, to achieve greater balance at both the
national and international levels. Existing inequalities,
whatever their origin, must necessarily be reduced to make
sure that the dangerous gap separating the industrialized
countries from the most disadvantaged countries does not
grow wider. The Ministers of Economics and Finance of 44
States and Governments members of the International
Organization of La Francophonie were able to devote
themselves to that subject during their first meeting, which
took place in Monaco on 14 and 15 April last.
Those leaders, like those who met in Geneva at the
July substantive session of the Economic and Social
Council, recognized that globalization, if poorly controlled,
could have serious consequences for the future of all
nations. Stepped up trade and investment, and the adoption
of policies of liberalization — sure engines of growth —
have not yet enabled everyone to enjoy significant
development. We must guard against some being barred
from progress and from the benefits of the major trends in
the world economy, something that could have serious
consequences.
Aware of that danger and of the deterioration in
international relations it could cause, ministers of the
economy or of finance of Francophone countries, meeting
in Monaco, recognized the need for better supervision of
the human and social effects of ongoing economic
processes, including structural adjustment policies. They
stressed the importance of maintaining, or indeed
increasing, official development assistance, while adopting
appropriate measures to encourage private investment. They
indicated their grave concern at the unbearable burden of
external debt for many countries. The Government of
Monaco shares that grave concern.
The Monaco Declaration issued at the end of their
meeting by ministers of the economy or of finance of
Francophone countries solemnly recalled the fundamental
link among economic development, democracy and good
governance. The Declaration stressed the importance of
upcoming multilateral trade negotiations, noted the mission
of the World Trade Organization to encompass all members
of the international community, and stressed the importance
of improving the international trading system so that it
will make a greater contribution to sustainable
development and to meeting the real expectations of
peoples. It also invited the world financial community to
maintain its assistance to development, through both
official and private contributions.
The Principality of Monaco, which joined the
Intergovernmental Agency of La Francophonie in
organizing this first meeting, is committed to contribute
actively to implementing the Monaco Declaration and to
encourage the establishment of a permanent Francophone
centre for gathering and exchanging economic
information; the recent summit of heads of State or
Government of Francophone countries, held at Moncton,
Canada, from 3 to 5 September, agreed to establish such
a centre in Monaco.
Supported by many world leaders, the Jubilee 2000
campaign to cancel debts that the poorest countries are
finding it difficult to repay enjoys wide backing. Given
certain modifications, it seems to us to be of great
interest, if only because it will enable countries
experiencing great difficulties to resume unhindered
progress towards development. Here, my country's leaders
are duly appreciative of the decision taken at Cologne last
June by the heads of State or Government of the seven
major industrialized countries and of Russia to reduce
significantly the external debt of some 40 such countries.
I reaffirm Monaco's unswerving determination to
meet its international obligations and its firm commitment
to the values of human rights and humanitarian principles,
and wish to affirm that the highest authorities of my
country are devoting close attention to progress in the
sphere of disarmament. The limitation and reduction of
nuclear weapons is a constant concern of the Government
of the Principality. In our view, universal ratification of
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT) — which, to our great satisfaction, was indefinitely
extended in 1995 — should be promoted, as should the
complete application of the comprehensive safeguards
system of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
whose remarkable International Laboratory of Marine
Radioactivity we have been honoured to host since 1986.
The year-2000 conference of States parties to the
NPT will be decisive. Here, my country praises those
countries, some of them close friends, that have made
major sacrifices to dismantle a portion of their nuclear
arsenals while taking great care with the processing of the
fissile materials extracted from them. We unreservedly
14


share the view of Governments that favour the formulation
and adoption of international rules to prohibit the
production of fissile materials intended for the production
of nuclear weapons and explosives.
The Government of the Principality considers that
controls intended to prevent transfers of materials and
equipment that could be used for the manufacture of
nuclear weapons should be strengthened, but it strongly
favours improved international cooperation for the peaceful
uses of nuclear energy — given, of course, all the
necessary precautions with respect to environmental
protection.
The Principality of Monaco earnestly hopes for an
early end to all nuclear-weapons tests; the threat that these
weapons pose to mankind has often, and rightly, been
denounced. We are convinced that the accession of all
Powers to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
(CTBT) — which my father, the reigning Prince, ratified on
20 November 1998 — would be a giant step towards
limiting these dreadful weapons of mass destruction. As a
party to the CTBT, the Principality would wish to see
greater commitment to that important treaty. We welcome
the existence of nuclear-weapon-free zones established on
the basis of arrangements freely entered into by the States
of various regions, and hope that strengthening confidence
and international security will ultimately lead to the spread
of such zones.
Let me recall the keen interest of the Principality of
Monaco in the implementation of the 1993 Paris
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and
on Their Destruction, to which my country has been a party
since 1 June 1995, and of the 1972 Convention on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling
of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on
Their Destruction, our instrument of accession to which was
deposited on 30 April 1999.
My country welcomes the measures adopted at
Maputo, Mozambique, last May, at the first Meeting of
States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel
Mines and on Their Destruction, which entered into force
in Monaco on 15 March 1999.
Engaged from the very beginning in the fight against
these deadly devices, which strike hardest at civilian
populations, particularly the elderly, women and children,
Monaco signed and quickly ratified this instrument. My
country is fully determined to continue its efforts to
contribute to eliminating these weapons once and for all.
When, on 12 November 1998, the Principality of
Monaco signed the International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombing, it wanted to make a
formal commitment and to place clearly on record its
position in this regard. Through me, Monaco confirms
that decision before the Assembly, once again
condemning all forms of terrorism, which blindly and
mercilessly strikes too many innocents, as we have had
occasion once again to note recently.
In this spirit, it is appropriate to pay a special tribute
to the United Nations Mission in East Timor for the role
it is playing and for the courage its representatives are
displaying, notably the members of the international staff
that remained in place under the gravest of threats.
In this connection, I should like once again to
forcefully reaffirm our complete solidarity with United
Nations personnel, some of whom this year have lost their
lives, been injured, or suffered violence and other grave
offenses. Monaco, which was among the first countries to
ratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and
Associated Personnel, deplores in the strongest terms and
condemns without reserve the inadmissible acts of
aggression and intimidation of which they have been
victims. We take this opportunity to salute the first among
United Nations personnel, the Secretary-General, who
enjoys our highest esteem for his actions at the head of
the Organization, particularly during periods of crisis and
in the extremely difficult circumstances with which he is
regularly confronted.












"
MCO,2016,"As we have been hearing since the beginning of the week, we are here as representatives of a world in crisis, a war-torn world, divided by inequality, shocked by ever- increasing massive population displacements, afflicted by hunger and disease, and torn apart and grief-stricken by violence. We are also the representatives of a world threatened by global warming, made vulnerable by attacks on biodiversity, and concerned at new dangers such as ocean acidification and the melting of the permafrost.
We are doubly responsible for the situation of the world. We are responsible as human beings, because the tragedy has but one perpetrator — humans and their insatiable hunger for power. From the depletion of farmland to the flooding of land swallowed up by rising water levels and cities flattened by bombs, it is always the same quest for power that is the cause of global violence, which is why we are all responsible.
But we are also here as leaders of nations who are responsible for the world’s future. It is up to us and the General Assembly to find responses to the suffering, injustice and other concerns. For 71 years, the United Nations has shown that it is capable of taking up those problems and offering the world sustainable solutions based on peace and cooperation. Over the past 10 years, under the stewardship of the Secretary-General, to whom I pay tribute, the United Nations has been at the forefront of all of the fights. Thanks to the Secretary- General, significant progress has been made on sustainable development with the adoption one year ago of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the adoption in December last year of a major agreement on climate change, the Paris Agreement.
Those accomplishments should inspire us today and strengthen our determination. In the face of the contradictions that we face in the world, the United Nations, I would note, is the only forum where coherent global action is possible. It is the only place where conflicting interests can have a peaceful encounter in a spirit of progress. It is the only place where responsibility for humankind can be upheld over the ambition of individuals. Here, and nowhere else, humankind has a meeting with history, with destiny and with the judgment that our children will pronounce on its actions.
The Principality of Monaco, under the impetus of its sovereign Prince, Prince Albert II, is fully committed to multilateralism as the only way of tackling the topics on our agenda. I would like to mention three such issues that encompass most of the world’s challenges.
The first is of course the issue of refugees and migrants, a topic that took up a large part of the beginning of the work of the current session of the General Assembly. All of us here are familiar with the tragedy that has afflicted so many civilian populations, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, and we know all too well the situation of the Syrian population, the 300,000 victims of the conflict and the tragedy of the survivors, caught in the middle of the violence committed by the State and the atrocities of the terrorists. Every month, every week, every day, the Mediterranean becomes the funeral shroud of dozens of women, children and men ready to risk everything to escape their fate, but for whom we can barely provide the little that they ask for — safety, subsistence and the hope of a better future.
That Mediterranean Sea, to which Monaco attaches great importance, the Sea that is both a link and a border to so many worlds, is once again at the heart of one of the main challenges of this new century. The Mediterranean today should help us understand that the tragedies on its shores are not those of different clashing worlds but rather the shores of the same world, ours. Regardless of our material situation or where we live, we cannot escape Earth’s and humankind’s woes. Whether we are dealing with wars or rising water levels, famines, storms or fanaticism, our interdependence is, from here on out, total. To quote John Donne, “Send not to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.”
That is the purpose of the United Nations and its Charter — to proclaim our common humanity, whatever difficulties may arise. In that regard, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), which has just been adopted, fortunately recalls the principles according to which we must act, as well as the moral and legal obligations that we must all comply with. In that connection, we must give special consideration to unaccompanied minors and children separated from their families. Furthermore, many people live in damaged ecosystems that threaten their very existence. According to the most recent projections of the United Nations, there may be as many as 250 million climate refugees by 2050. Therefore, environmental degradation could tomorrow become the primary cause of migration. Hence, the importance of protecting our environment and implementing sustainable development for all. That represents a major commitment for Monaco and our Sovereign Prince Albert II, who for more than 20 years has been personally committed to that issue, both in all international forums where those subjects were addressed and in the field, working closely with affected populations.
Reconciling the imperatives of human development and those of the conservation of the Earth so as to make it possible for a population of 8 or 9 billion people in a few years to live together will be the major challenge of our century. In order to achieve that, we must first protect the climate.
The Paris Agreement, for which the Principality campaigned, represents a milestone. Monaco will become party to that Agreement by the end of 2016, once its National Council has adopted the law for its ratification. I also recall that Monaco is committed to reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 as compared with emission levels in 1990.
Despite its small responsibility for global emissions, our country has the ambition to be a leader in using innovative means of transport and energy consumption.
In addition to preserving our common heritage and to limiting pollution, the use of inexhaustible renewable energy will also allow us to break with certain monopolies that generate inequalities today and destabilize our world. Such a programme of energy transfer has a cost, but we are convinced that that cost is small compared to the consequences of inaction. That is why Monaco is committed to maintaining its support for the Green Climate Fund.
Global warming has several tragic consequences. One of them is related to the situation of the oceans. As we know, the sea surfaces have been severely neglected, even though they are critical for our common future. Monaco has a long-standing commitment to that issue, dating back to Prince Albert I, who was one of the founders of modern oceanography over 100 years ago. Since then, the Principality has taken action whenever the future of our seas was at stake. It did so in 2009, when it hosted 150 international scientists, who signed the Monaco Declaration, the first global warning about the acidification of the oceans. It also acted by taking on various targeted initiatives within the competent bodies, such as the one that made it possible for us to save bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean. It also acted through the appeal, launched by Prince Albert II at the General Assembly in 2013, aimed at including what became Sustainable Development Goal 14 on the oceans in the 2030 Agenda. It continues to take action, month after month, by contributing to the development of protected coastal marine areas and to the future establishment of a network of protected areas on the high seas.
We are convinced that such conservation solutions will bring about extremely positive effects for the ecosystems and the populations that are directly or potentially affected. Similarly, the Principality of Monaco has taken action in the very important negotiations that are taking place today at the United Nations on issues of biodiversity and national jurisdiction.
All of those issues are essential for the Principality of Monaco. All of those issues take into account a primordial concern, which is the creation of our common future. It was through their ability to dominate and transform nature that our ancestors were able to develop and secure the future of their children. However, we must now also admit that it is through our capacity to protect nature and accept its rules that we can realize our potential and build a future for humankind. That change in the model disrupts our ways of thinking. It will take time for it to take hold and to replace the traditional ways of thinking that have shaped our world and its inhabitants for millenniums.
What we need to do today is to bring about a change of civilization. However, we can make progress in that direction only if all of humankind comes along with us with its dreams and desires. The 2016 UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report also highlights a priority — that of education. Forty per cent of 15-year- old children have basic knowledge of environmental issues. That brings me to the third issue for our Organization that I would like to underscore today before the Assembly.
More than ever, UNICEF, which is celebrating its seventieth anniversary this year, should play a central role in solving the world’s problems, many of which relate to women and children. At a time when women are still subjected to so much violence and discrimination and when sexual violence is increasing in such an unacceptable way, we should also support the crucial work of UNICEF. In that respect, I would also like to reiterate the full support of the Principality of Monaco for the Security Council resolutions on women and peace and security, on the protection of women in times of conflict and the strengthening of their role in peacekeeping, restoring peace and building of peace. In our unstable and unjust world, we know that education, especially that of girls, is the solution to many of the problems we face. It is through women that the values of tolerance and respect can be upheld. That is why the education of girls and, more broadly, the equal education of all children should be a priority for all.
The power of the United Nations lies in bringing States together to work in the service of the common good. That common good is today still high on the agenda of the Assembly. We must better manage refugees and migrants by protecting the planet and through education for children and the establishment of a genuine equality between men and women. That is the path that Monaco will follow. Loyal to its values, its history and its commitments, the Principality of Monaco will continue, with determination, to move forward along that path, together with the entire international community, for a better future.
"
MCO,2020,"Mr. President of the General Assembly,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The particular circumstances of the general debate at this 75th session of the General Assembly are anecdotal when, for months, families, communities and countries have been caught up in the turmoil of the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences.
I would like to commend here the leadership of His Excellency Professor Tijjani Muhammad Bande. He was able to stay the course in particularly difficult times and allow the General Assembly to pursue the crux of its work.
I would also like to warmly thank the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, and through him all the United Nations staff, who have never ceased to mobilize the United Nations system even in areas of conflict in order to protect the most vulnerable.
Development activity reforms have enabled the effective coordination of teams on the ground and highlighted the skills, dedication and courage of those women and men who work on a daily basis to honour the mandates we have entrusted to them.
Mr. President Bozkir, you have given pre-eminence to consultation and coordination, so that member States can stand up to the immense challenges in a spirit of mutual aid and efficiency.
You know that you can count on the full cooperation of my delegation as the Principality of Monaco assumes one of the Presidencies of this 75th session.
Mr. President,
In recent years, the world has endured a succession of crises that we have had to confront in this forum: the rise of terrorism, the intensification of migratory flows, climatic shifts, the financial crisis of 2008 and now the pandemic that is generating an economic and social crisis.
Despite these major obstacles, we have adopted innovative guidelines: the 2030 Agenda for development and its SDGs in 2015, as well as the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and the global Compact for safe migration in 2018, to name just a few.
The international system is nevertheless destabilized and multilateralism is being called into question. In a context where nationalist and protectionist tendencies are resurgent, it is vital that we mobilize in a coordinated and united manner.
No State, regardless of size or military or economic power, can meet the current international challenges on its own.
The interconnectedness of our States demands a coordinated response to transnational threats that undermine hard-won progress and weaken international peace and security.
The sudden shutdown imposed on our economies by the necessary lockdown has impacted our resources.
Monaco, resolutely committed to multilateralism and its institutions, has fulfilled its statutory commitments and will continue to comply with its obligations. Faithful to its tradition of solidarity with the most vulnerable, the Principality has consequently joined in the collective effort to fight the pandemic, in particular by responding to the global emergency plea launched by the United Nations.
Mr. President,
The Secretary-General has called for building a multilateralism of networks by bringing together all agencies, organizations and entities at the local, regional and international level. It is indeed by being more inclusive, listening to all, that we can be assured “of leaving no one behind”.
As such, women and girls can no longer be excluded from such a movement in this year marked by a triple anniversary: 25 years of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, 20 years since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 on “Women, Peace and Security” and 10 years since the creation of UN Women.
That means equality between women and men has been on our agenda for 25 years and yet women and girls are still the main group affected by inequalities.
Despite some progress, the situation in the world is changing extremely slowly.
Moreover, the 2020 report on the sustainable development Goals underscores the heavy toll women are paying in the face of the crisis, making the achievement of SDG 5 increasingly distant.
It is women who are most involved in the fight against COVID-19 and therefore the most exposed to contamination, and at the same time, a strong and intolerable increase in cases of domestic violence is to be deplored, as well as a particularly high school dropout rate for girls.
My Government is resolutely committed to defending the interests of women and will continue its efforts, through the Committee for the Promotion and Protection of Women’s Rights, created in 2018, to reduce inequalities and fight against discrimination and violence, of which women are still too often the victims.
It is also by listening to and trusting young people that we will build a more robust and sustainable future.
Political inclusion is a central demand of youth. Over the past year, many of us have praised the commitment that young people have shown on the climate issue.
Today, although young people are less affected by the COVID-19 virus, it is they who are bearing the full brunt of the resulting economic crisis. Many of them are affected by precarious status that does not provide them with social protection. Others find themselves cut off from any means of access to education. It is essential that we establish specific provisions in order to prevent our young people from finding themselves permanently stuck in the poverty trap.
Mr. President,
While new technologies have largely contributed to the development of our societies, they have unfortunately contributed to the rise of a new context of insecurity. The past few months have accelerated the digital transition on a tremendous scale, but these advances have also been accompanied by an explosion of cyberattacks.
Cyberspace is now an area of conflict in its own right, just like the land, sea and sky.
What becomes of sovereignty in the digital age, when security, law, the economy, taxation and currency are called into question? In my view, it is important to agree on common rules in order to adopt a framework of appropriate measures and proper conduct. That is not only to guarantee a better functioning of our institutions, but also to ensure the preservation of States’ sovereignty and individual freedoms.
At the same time, the wave of disinformation has intensified, particularly via social media in recent months. Our societies are vulnerable to these manoeuvres. Also, I welcome the awareness campaign launched by the United Nations to combat fake news.
Monaco has undertaken to acquire strong digital skills, on the one hand, to seize the many opportunities offered by digital technology in economic and environmental spheres and, on the other hand, to ensure sustainable development that is respectful of people.
Therefore, the responsible and sustainable digital model that I wanted for my country is accompanied not only by significant investments in infrastructure, training and business support, but also by the enactment of legislative rules.
Mr. President,
We cannot discuss this new context of insecurity without mentioning the gravity of the climate crisis. Large-scale natural disasters will intensify and, as we know, cause emergency humanitarian situations and the displacement of populations. These disasters will have an impact on access to natural resources. These phenomena are vectors of political instability and conflict.
The current pandemic has demonstrated how vulnerable we are when we destroy the planet’s ecosystems. Scientists are clear on this, and we should expect an increased risk of these types of epidemics if we do not change our behaviour.
The slowdown in our activities as a result of the pandemic has not changed the curve of rising temperatures nor reduced nature’s destruction.
Meanwhile, the postponement of major environmental meetings does not mean indefinitely suspending our commitments but calls instead for a redoubling of our efforts. The urgency is still there and, more than ever, it is necessary for us all to mobilize.
In this regard, I would like to commend the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene a Biodiversity Summit, thereby granting it its rightful place at the heart of our political agenda. The collective decision to go ahead with the event on 30 September, despite the current health context, confirms this commitment to which I fully subscribe.
Monaco is, and shall remain, resolutely committed to environmental protection and sustainable development. Whether by pursuing the energy transition, accelerating the development of soft mobility, or promoting the circular economy, the Principality has placed the development of consumption and production methods at the heart of its vision of society. Each aspect of the Monegasque Government’s action must form part of the demands of sustainable development. This is the line that I set for it in 2005.
Mr. President,
While the current crisis has focused much of our global attention on growth figures and economic recovery, there is a significant risk that we will deviate from the other pillars of sustainable development.
It is therefore essential that we seize the opportunity before us to rethink our economic and social models based on principles that respect the environment.
Now more than ever, the road map that we established in 2015 must guide us during this period of great uncertainty. Now more than ever, the COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrating that it is crucial to achieve the goals defined by the 2030 Agenda for development, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
To do this, greater ambition and mobilization are necessary, not only to defeat COVID-19 but also to adapt our multilateral cooperation instruments.
The period of social distancing we are currently living through should prompt us to echo the message “To leave no one behind” that we placed at the heart of the SDGs and the opening words of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter “We, the peoples of the United Nations”, so as to increase our solidarity.
Thank you for your attention."
